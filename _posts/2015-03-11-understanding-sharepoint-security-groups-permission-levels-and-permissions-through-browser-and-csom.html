<div id="post">

<p>Security groups, permission levels, and permissions are core
concepts of
SharePoint's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-based_access_control">role-based
security model</a> which can be hard to grasp. Especially since the
browser interface and the object model use different terminology for
the same concepts and the object model adds additional concepts to
record inter-object relationships. Thus, through screenshots and code,
in this post, I'll attempt to correlate security information from the
user interface with that of the object model.</p>

<h2>Setup</h2>

<p>All code snippets in this post assume the SharePoint context object
has already been initialized. For completeness sake, here's the code
to setup the context:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint lang-cs">
class Program {
    static void Main() {
        var siteCollection = new Uri("https://bugfree.sharepoint.com/teams/AcmeCorpTeamSiteCollection");
        var user = "rh@bugfree.onmicrosoft.com";
        var password = "password";
        var securePassword = new SecureString();
        password.ToCharArray().ToList().ForEach(securePassword.AppendChar);
        var credentials = new SharePointOnlineCredentials(user, securePassword);
        var ctx = new ClientContext(siteCollection) { Credentials = credentials };
        var rootWeb = ctx.Site.RootWeb;

        // code below goes here.
    }
}
</pre>

<h2>Site permissions and security groups</h2>

<p>Starting from the top of the security hierarchy, the Site
permissions menu item under Site settings shows the site collection's
SharePoint security groups, including their permission levels.</p>

<p>
  <img src="/content/sharepoint-site-permissions.png" width="75%">
</p>

<p>To list the same set of security groups using the object model, the
following code is required:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint lang-cs">
ctx.Load(rootWeb, w => w.SiteGroups);
ctx.ExecuteQuery();

// AcmeCorpTeamSiteCollection Members
// AcmeCorpTeamSiteCollection Owners
// AcmeCorpTeamSiteCollection Visitors
// Excel Services Viewers
foreach (var group in rootWeb.SiteGroups) {
    System.Console.WriteLine(group.Title);
}
</pre>

<p>When SharePoint created this site collection, the fixed set of
security groups got created with it. Afterwards, we may create
additional security groups and use those in any web in the site
collection.</p>

<p>Note the use of the ambiguous term site in the user interface and
in the CSOM API. In general, site can refer to either site collection
or web depending on the context. Here it refers to site collection
because security groups exist at the site collection level and only at
the site collection level.</p>

<p>This implies that creating a new web and breaking role inheritance
(through the browser interface), even though SharePoint creates
additional members, owners, and visitors groups and associates those
with the new web, the security groups themselves are created at the
site collection level and hence are visible and usable from any web
within the site collection.</p>

<p>Conversely, creating a security group isn't useful in itself --
it's nothing but a container for SharePoint users and Active Directory
groups. The security group must be associated with a securable object,
such as a web, list, or list item for it to attain meaning.</p>

<h2>Role assignments relating site groups with role definitions</h2>

<p>Now, given a securable object such as a web, we can iterate its
role assignments using the code below. The term role assignment refers
to an object used to track the many-to-many relationship between site
groups on one hand and role definitions on the other. One site group
such as Members, may be associated with any number of role
definitions, such as Read or Edit or custom ones. Each role definition
in turn may be used across any number of site groups. In other words,
the role assignment construct is an indirection mechanism used to
decouple site groups from role definitions, furthering their
reuse.</p>

<p>It's this collection of role definitions which the browser displays
under the Site permissions menu. What the user interface calls
permission levels, the object model calls role definitions.</p>

<pre class="prettyprint lang-cs">
// Excel Services Viewers
//   View Only
// AcmeCorpTeamSiteCollection Owners
//   Full Control
// AcmeCorpTeamSiteCollection Visitors
//   Read
// AcmeCorpTeamSiteCollection Members
//   Edit
ctx.Load(rootWeb, w => w.RoleAssignments);
ctx.ExecuteQuery();

foreach (var ra in rootWeb.RoleAssignments) {
    ctx.Load(ra.Member);
    ctx.Load(ra.RoleDefinitionBindings);
    ctx.ExecuteQuery();

    System.Console.WriteLine(ra.Member.Title);
    foreach (var binding in ra.RoleDefinitionBindings) {
        System.Console.WriteLine("  " + binding.Name);
    }
}
</pre>

<p>These are the standard role definitions created by SharePoint
during site collection creation. Like with security groups, we can
create our own role definition and associate those with groups. For
instance, we may deviate from the out of the box behavior and create a
role definition for when contributors should only be allowed to add
items to lists and not delete. Or where visitors should be able to
create and save personal views on lists, which aren't allowed by
default.</p>

<p>In any event, never modify an out of the box role
definition. Instead, create a new one and reset the binding where
applicable. This'll make long-term maintenance and upgrading
easier.</p>

<h2>Role definitions and base permissions</h2>

<p>From the ribbon in Site permissions, the Permission levels button
list all permission levels. Note how more levels are listed under
permission levels than Site permissions, implying that not all
permission levels are in use by default:

<p>
  <img src="/content/sharepoint-permission-levels.png" width="55%">
</p>

<p>Clicking a permission level displays a list of permissions, each of
which can be turned on or off. The screenshot only includes the first
couple of permissions:</p>

<p>
  <img src="/content/sharepoint-permissions.png" width="60%">
</p>

<p>Like with security groups and role definitions, a similar
many-to-many relationship exists between RoleDefinitions and
BasePermissions (and for the same reason of decoupling). Note also how
it's slightly confusing that both the name of the property on the
RoleDefinition class and the property's underlying type is
BasePermissions.</p>

<p>In the object model, base permissions are represented by the
PermissionKind enumeration. For each role definition, we may iterate
this enumeration to get the base permissions which are turned on:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint lang-cs">
// Full Control
//   EmptyMask
//   ViewListItems
//   AddListItems
//   EditListItems
//   DeleteListItems
//   ...
// Design
//   ...
// Edit
//   ...
// Contribute
//   ...
// Read
//   ...
// Limited Access
//   ...
// View Only 
//   ...
var kinds = Enum.GetValues(typeof(PermissionKind));
ctx.Load(rootWeb, w => w.RoleDefinitions);
ctx.ExecuteQuery();

foreach (var roleDefinition in rootWeb.RoleDefinitions) {
    System.Console.WriteLine(roleDefinition.Name);
    foreach (PermissionKind kind in kinds) {
        if (roleDefinition.BasePermissions.Has(kind)) {
            System.Console.WriteLine("  " + kind);
        }
    }
}
</pre>

<p>The set of base permissions is hardcoded into SharePoint and thus
can only be modified by Microsoft. In principle, though, the set of
base permissions could've been made extensible. We would then have
been able to create domain specific base permissions and test on those
in code. But given the already (too) complex security model, the
SharePoint team seems to have decided against it.</p>

<h2>Example: modifying web associated owner, visitor, and member groups</h2>

<p>The owners, visitors, and members groups -- or more specifically
the role assignments related to each group -- are intrinsic to the web
object. It has distinct properties for associating an owner, visitor,
and member group with a web object. This seems odd, compared to simply
adding role assignments to the web object and having their role
definitions and base permissions define what a user can do. For some
reason, the SharePoint team decided to add an extra discriminator to
the security equation so that inside a web, we can assert the user has
a specific permission <em>and</em> has as a special group
association.</p>

<p>Let's list the associations (don't believe there's a page
displaying the same information):</p>

<pre class="prettyprint lang-cs">
ctx.Load(rootWeb,
    w => w.AssociatedOwnerGroup,
    w => w.AssociatedVisitorGroup,
    w => w.AssociatedMemberGroup);
ctx.ExecuteQuery();

// AcmeCorpTeamSiteCollection Owners
// AcmeCorpTeamSiteCollection Visitors
// AcmeCorpTeamSiteCollection Members
System.Console.WriteLine(web.AssociatedOwnerGroup.Title);
System.Console.WriteLine(web.AssociatedVisitorGroup.Title);
System.Console.WriteLine(web.AssociatedMemberGroup.Title);
</pre>

<p>Any security group may be designated the web's owner, visitor, or
member group by assigning it to the corresponding property on the
web. It just so happened that during site collection creation,
SharePoint created groups with names of owners, visitors, and members
prefixed by site collection title and setup the associations on our
behalf.</p>

<p>Now, let's redefine the default visitors group associated with the
root web. First we locate the associated security group (it can be any
custom created security groups previously assigned). Then we load the
group's role assignments and modify its bindings to include Full
Control.</p>

<pre class="prettyprint lang-cs">
ctx.Load(rootWeb.AssociatedVisitorGroup);
var availableRoleDefinitions = rootWeb.RoleDefinitions;
ctx.Load(availableRoleDefinitions);
ctx.ExecuteQuery();

var roleAssignmentsForVisitorGroup = rootWeb.RoleAssignments.GetByPrincipal(rootWeb.AssociatedVisitorGroup);
ctx.Load(roleAssignmentsForVisitorGroup, ra => ra.RoleDefinitionBindings);
ctx.ExecuteQuery();

// the Read permission level is added by SharePoint by default
//roleAssignmentsForVisitorGroup.RoleDefinitionBindings.RemoveAll();
roleAssignmentsForVisitorGroup.RoleDefinitionBindings.Add(availableRoleDefinitions.GetByName("Full Control"));
roleAssignmentsForVisitorGroup.Update();
ctx.ExecuteQuery();
</pre>

<p>With the above change, every SharePoint user and Active Directory
group added to the visitors security group operate have Full control
permissions within the site collection.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>In order to keep track of the concepts and their relationships,
think of the SharePoint security model in terms of the following
layering:</p>

<pre>
Securable object (Web, list, list item)
  Role assignments
    Member (AcmeCorpTeamSiteCollection Visitors, custom security groups)
    RoleDefinitionBindings
      RoleDefinitions
        RoleDefinition (Read, Contribute, custom role definitions)
          BasePermissions (ViewListItem, EditListItem)
</pre>

<p>When SharePoint has to determine if a user is authorized to perform
a certain action, such as editing a list item, SharePoint computes the
user's effective set of base permissions for the securable object in
question (in this case a list item). The computation involves taking
into account all role assignments of the securable object and
logically OR'ing together their indirectly related base
permissions. Only if the resulting set includes EditListItem is the
user allowed to edit the list item.</p>
