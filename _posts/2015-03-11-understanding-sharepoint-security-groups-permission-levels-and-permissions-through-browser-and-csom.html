<div id="post">

<p>Security groups, permission levels, and permissions are core
concepts of SharePoint's role-based security model which can be hard
to grock. Especially since the browser interface and the object model
use different terminology for the same concepts and the object model
adds additional concepts to record inter-object relationships. Thus,
through screenshots and code, in this post, I'll attempt to correlate
information in the user interface with that of the object model.</p>

<h2>Setup</h2>

<p>The code snippets in this post assume the availability of a valid
SharePoint context. For completeness sake, here's the code to setup
the context:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint lang-cs">
class Program {
    static void Main() {
        var siteCollection = new Uri("https://bugfree.sharepoint.com/teams/AcmeCorpTeamSiteCollection");
        var user = "rh@bugfree.onmicrosoft.com";
        var password = "password";
        var securePassword = new SecureString();
        password.ToCharArray().ToList().ForEach(securePassword.AppendChar);
        var credentials = new SharePointOnlineCredentials(user, securePassword);
        var ctx = new ClientContext(siteCollection) { Credentials = credentials };
        var rootWeb = ctx.Site.RootWeb;

        // code below goes here.
    }
}
</pre>

<h2>Site permissions and security groups</h2>

<p>Starting from the top of the security hierarchy, the Site
permissions menu item under Site settings shows the SharePoint
security groups in a site collection, including their permission
levels.</p>

<p>
  <img src="/content/sharepoint-site-permissions.png" width="75%">
</p>

<p>To list these same security groups using the object model, the
following code is required:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint lang-cs">
ctx.Load(rootWeb, w => w.SiteGroups);
ctx.ExecuteQuery();

// AcmeCorpTeamSiteCollection Members
// AcmeCorpTeamSiteCollection Owners
// AcmeCorpTeamSiteCollection Visitors
// Excel Services Viewers
foreach (var group in rootWeb.SiteGroups) {
    System.Console.WriteLine(group.Title);
}
</pre>

<p>Note how site is an ambiguous term used by SharePoint to refer to
either site collection or web, depending on the context. Here it's
assumed to mean site collection.</p>

<p>When SharePoint creates the site collection, this fixed set of
security groups get created with it. Afterwards we may create
additional security groups and use those in any web in the site
collection.</p>

<p>There's a subtle detail to security groups worth being aware of:
they exist at the site collection level and only at the site
collection level. This implies that when creating a new web and
breaking role inheritance, even though SharePoint creates additional
members, owners, and visitors groups and associates those with the new
web, the security groups themselves are created at the site collection
level and hence visible and usable from any web within the site
collection.</p>

<p>Conversely, creating a security group isn't useful in itself --
it's nothing but a container for SharePoint users and Active Directory
groups. The security group must be associated with a securable object,
such as a web, list, or list item for it to have an impact.</p>

<h2>Role assignments relating site groups with role definitions</h2>

<p>Now, given a web, which is a securable object, we can iterate its
role assignments using the code below. The term role assignment refers
to an object used to track the many-to-many relationship between site
groups on one hand and role definitions on the other. One site groups,
such as Members, may be associated with any number of role
definitions, such as Read or Edit or custom ones. Each role definition
in turn may be used across any number of site groups.</p>

<p>The role assignment is an indirection mechanism used to decouple
site groups from role definitions, furthering their reuse. It's these
role assignments which the browser displays under Site permissions
menu. What the user interface calls a permission level, the object
model calls a role definition.</p>

<pre class="prettyprint lang-cs">
// Excel Services Viewers
//   View Only
// AcmeCorpTeamSiteCollection Owners
//   Full Control
// AcmeCorpTeamSiteCollection Visitors
//   Read
// AcmeCorpTeamSiteCollection Members
//   Edit
ctx.Load(rootWeb, w => w.RoleAssignments);
ctx.ExecuteQuery();

foreach (var ra in rootWeb.RoleAssignments) {
    ctx.Load(ra.Member);
    ctx.Load(ra.RoleDefinitionBindings);
    ctx.ExecuteQuery();
    System.Console.WriteLine(ra.Member.Title);

    foreach (var binding in ra.RoleDefinitionBindings) {
        System.Console.WriteLine("  " + binding.Name);
    }
}
</pre>

<p>These are the standard role definitions created by SharePoint. And
like with security groups, we can create our own and associate those
with groups. For instance, we may want to create a custom role
definition to support the case where contributors should only be
allowed to add items, but not the delete any.</p>

<h2>Role definitions and base permissions</h2>

<p>From the Site permissions page, in the ribbon we can click the
Permission levels button to get a list of all available permission
levels. Note how not all permission levels are in use by default, so
the permission levels page lists more items than on the Site
permissions page:

<p>
  <img src="/content/sharepoint-permission-levels.png" width="55%">
</p>

<p>When we click a permission level, we get to the complete list of
permissions, each of which we can toggle on or off (the screenshot
only includes the first couple of permissions):</p>

<p>
  <img src="/content/sharepoint-permissions.png" width="60%">
</p>

<p>Like with RoleDefinitionBindings storing the relationship between
security groups and role definitions, a similar many-to-many
relationship exists between RoleDefinitions and BasePermissions (and
for the same reason of decoupling). Note how both the name of property
on RoleDefinition and the property's underlying type is
BasePermissions.</p>

<p>This set of base permissions is hardcoded into SharePoint and thus
can only be extended by Microsoft. In principle, the base permissions
could've been made extensible. Our code would then have been able to
take advantage of domain specific base permissions.</p>

<p>In the object model, base permission are represented by the
PermissionKind enumeration. For each role definition, we can iterate
this enumeration to get all the the base permissions which are turned
on:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint lang-cs">
var kinds = Enum.GetValues(typeof(PermissionKind));
ctx.Load(rootWeb, w => w.RoleDefinitions);
ctx.ExecuteQuery();

// Full Control
//   EmptyMask
//   ViewListItems
//   AddListItems
//   EditListItems
//   DeleteListItems
//   ...
// Design
//  ...
// Edit
//  ...
// Contribute
//  ...
// Read
//   ...
//Limited Access
//  ...
// View Only 
//  ...
var kinds = Enum.GetValues(typeof(PermissionKind));
ctx.Load(rootWeb, w => w.RoleDefinitions);
ctx.ExecuteQuery();

foreach (var roleDefinition in rootWeb.RoleDefinitions) {
    System.Console.WriteLine(roleDefinition.Name);
    foreach (PermissionKind kind in kinds) {
        if (roleDefinition.BasePermissions.Has(kind)) {
            System.Console.WriteLine("  " + kind);
        }
    }
}
</pre>

<h2>Web associated owner, visitor, and member groups</h2>

<p>The Owners, Visitors, and Members groups (or more specifically the
role assignments related to these groups) are intrinsic to the web
object in that it has properties for setting each. Let's first list
the associations and then we try and modify one:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint lang-cs">
ctx.Load(rootWeb,
    w => w.AssociatedOwnerGroup,
    w => w.AssociatedVisitorGroup,
    w => w.AssociatedMemberGroup);
ctx.ExecuteQuery();

// AcmeCorpTeamSiteCollection Owners
// AcmeCorpTeamSiteCollection Visitors
// AcmeCorpTeamSiteCollection Members
System.Console.WriteLine(web.AssociatedOwnerGroup.Title);
System.Console.WriteLine(web.AssociatedVisitorGroup.Title);
System.Console.WriteLine(web.AssociatedMemberGroup.Title);
</pre>

<p>Any security group can be designated owner, visitor, or member by
assigning it to the corresponding property. It just happens that
SharePoint creates groups with names of Owners, Visitors, and Members
prefixed by site collection name and then sets up the association on
our behalf.</p>

<p>Remember how in the previous section we learned that a security
groups isn't useful in and of itself. It must be associated with one
or more role definitions. Thus, by indirection, when we set the
Associated properties on a web what we're really asking is to use the
role assignments set for the group in the site collections.</p>

<p>Let's try to redefining the default Visitors group associated with
the root web. First we must locate the group used as visitor which can
be any security groups. Then we load up the group's role assignments
and modify its bindings to include Full Control.</p>

<pre class="prettyprint lang-cs">
ctx.Load(rootWeb.AssociatedVisitorGroup);
var availableRoleDefinitions = rootWeb.RoleDefinitions;
ctx.Load(availableRoleDefinitions);
ctx.ExecuteQuery();

var roleAssignmentsForVisitorGroup = rootWeb.RoleAssignments.GetByPrincipal(rootWeb.AssociatedVisitorGroup);
ctx.Load(roleAssignmentsForVisitorGroup, ra => ra.RoleDefinitionBindings);
ctx.ExecuteQuery();

// the Read permission level is the added by SharePoint by default
//roleAssignmentsForVisitorGroup.RoleDefinitionBindings.RemoveAll();
roleAssignmentsForVisitorGroup.RoleDefinitionBindings.Add(availableRoleDefinitions.GetByName("Full Control"));
roleAssignmentsForVisitorGroup.Update();
ctx.ExecuteQuery();
</pre>

<p>Now every SharePoint user and Active Directory group added to the
visitors security group operate with these permissions inside the site
collection.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Internally, when SharePoint needs to determine if a user is
authorized to carry out a specific action such as modify list item,
the user's effective set of base permissions is computed by logically
OR'ing together the base permissions of all security groups of which
the user is a member.</p>

<p>In summary, here's a mental model for how the concepts of the
client side object model fit together:</p>

<pre>
Securable object (Web, list, list item)
  Role assignments
    Member (rh-prov-0068 Visitors, custom security groups)
    RoleDefinitionBindings
      RoleDefinitions
        RoleDefinition (Read, Contribute, custom role definitions)
          BasePermissions (ViewListItem, EditListItem)
</pre>

<p>What all the layers of indirection add are ways to add or remove
base permission in various intricate ways.</p>
