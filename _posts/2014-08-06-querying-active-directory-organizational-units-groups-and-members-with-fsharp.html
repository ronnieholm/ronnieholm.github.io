<p>
I was recently faced with the task of mapping part of an Active
Directory structure onto domain types. The relevant subset of Active
Directory containers hold courses, such as English, each course
subdivided into one or more classes (English A, B, C). Students are
then added to each class. The purpose of my F# code is to construct a
collection of courses containing classes containing students for later
processing.
</p>

<pre>
DC=Acme, DC=local
  OU=Acme
    OU=Administration and Access
      OU=Groups
        OU=Courses
          OU=English
            objectGUID (attribute)
            name (attribute)
            CN=English A
              objectGuid (attribute)
              name (attribute)
              member (attribute pointing to Students)      
            CN=English B
            CN=English C     
          OU=Math
          OU=Drama
          ...
    OU=User Accounts
      OU=Students
        CN=John Doe
          objectGUID (attribute)
          name (attribute)
          mail (attribute)
        CN=Jane Doe
        ...
</pre>

<p>
The first order of business is to define F# types that represent the
output. The simple types define an aggregate with Course as its root
and child types matching the hierarchy of containers in Active
Directory.
</p>

<pre class="prettyprint lang-ml">
open System
open System.Collections
open System.DirectoryServices

type Student =
    { Id: Guid
      Name: string
      Mail: string }

type Class =
    { Id: Guid
      Name: string
      Students: Student list }

type Course =
    { Id: Guid
      Name: string
      Classes: Class list }
</pre>

<p>
The task is now to map the hierarchical data structure of Active
Directory containers onto the three newly defined F# types. Instead of
creating a repository (apperantly
a <a href="http://www.wekeroad.com/2014/03/04/repositories-and-unitofwork-are-not-a-good-idea/">repositories
got a bad rep</a>) representing Active Directory, I went with a query
type:
</p>

<pre class="prettyprint lang-ml">
type CoursesQuery(username: string, password: string, server: string) =
    let parseStudents (e: DirectoryEntry) =
        // accessing members through e.Properties.["member"] only yields
        // CommonName and path to object in string form. CommonName
        // isn't unique, however. Instead we follow the path and read 
        // properties directly of the student object.
        let members = e.Invoke("members", null)
        [ for dn in (members :?> IEnumerable) do
            use e = new DirectoryEntry(dn)
            printfn "Member: %A" e.Properties.["name"].[0]
            yield { 
                Id = e.Guid
                Name = e.Properties.["name"].[0] |> string
                Mail = e.Properties.["mail"].[0] |> string } ]

    let parseClass (klass: DirectoryEntry) =
        { Id = Guid(klass.Properties.["objectGUID"].[0] :?> byte[])
          Name = klass.Properties.["name"].[0] |> string
          Students = parseStudents klass |> Seq.toList }

    let parseCourse (sr: SearchResult) =
        { Id = Guid(sr.Properties.["objectGUID"].[0] :?> byte[])
          Name = sr.Properties.["name"].[0] |> string
          Classes =
            sr.GetDirectoryEntry().Children 
            |> Seq.cast<DirectoryEntry> 
            |> Seq.map (fun c -> 
                printfn "Class: %A" c.Properties.["name"].[0]
                parseClass c)
            |> Seq.toList }

    member __.Execute() =
        let coursesDirectory = 
            new DirectoryEntry(
                Username = username,
                Password = password,
                Path = sprintf 
                    "LDAP://%s/OU=Courses,OU=Groups,OU=Administration and Access,OU=Acme,DC=Acme,DC=local" server)

        let coursesSearcher = 
            new DirectorySearcher(
                SearchRoot = coursesDirectory, 
                Filter = "(ou=*)")

        coursesSearcher.FindAll()
        |> Seq.cast<SearchResult> 
        |> Seq.map (fun c -> 
            printfn "Course: %A" c.Properties.["name"].[0]
            parseCourse c)
        |> Seq.toList
</pre>

<p>Calling Execute on CoursesQuery results in a list of courses being
returned.</p>

<p>Depending on the specific needs, this sort of mapping may be too
slow. The way the code traverses the containers results in significant
request/reply network chatter. If performance is paramount, one should
come up with one or multiple LDAP queries. It's like the difference
between querying an SQL database with many small select queries versus
using joins.</p>
