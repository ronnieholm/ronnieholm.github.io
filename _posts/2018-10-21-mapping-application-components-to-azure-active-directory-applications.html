<div id="post">

<p>Deploying a real-world application with multiple components which
must all authorize
against <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory">Azure
Active Directory</a>, a common point of confusion is the number of app
registrations needed. Many blog posts tend to focus on simple
scenarios and the guidance provided on the Azure Portal's App
registration page isn't exhaustive. It's easy to err on the side of
registering too few applications, which may technically work but
doesn't map well to the needs of the components and how they're likely
to evolve.</p>

<p>This post attempts to provide common points of reasoning to aid in
determining when to create an app registration.</p>

<h3>Real-world use case</h3>

<p>As an example, consider the following application implemented as a
distributed set of components: a native iOS application which must
make authorized calls to an ASP.NET Core Web API. Add to the mix an
Angular app also required to make authorized calls the same Web
API.</p>

<p>Inside the Azure portal, creating a new App registration, for the
application type we have a choice between "Web app / API" or
"Native". Within
the <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749">OAuth2
specification</a>, however, application types are
called <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-2.1">client
profiles</a>, and there's three options: web application,
user-agent-based application (a fancy term for a browser hosting a
JavaScript application), and native application. Inside the Azure
Portal, user-agent-based application maps to "Web app / API" with the
registration
manifest's <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/reference-app-manifest">oauth2AllowImplicitFlow</a>
flipped to true.
</p>

<p>From these definitions, it's clear that iOS app maps to "Native"
and Web API to "Web app / API", but what about the Angular app? Well,
it's also a "Web app / API" but can and should it run under the Web
API's registration?</p>

<h3>Points of reasoning</h3>

<p>Perhaps in the name of brevity, many blog posts share the app
registration between Web API and an Angular app. But for anything but
the simplest use cases, reusing an app registration is at best a
shortcut to avoid an additional app registration and at worst a
potential security risk:</p>

<ul>

<li><p>Almost always should the Angular app have its own app
registration. Only in a small, contained Angular app/Web API case
where both are designed to only work with each other as a single unit,
without integrating with other APIs, is sharing a registration a
viable option.</p></li>

<li><p>Authorization on a per-application basis doesn't apply with
only one app registration for the Angular app and Web API. With both
assigned the same permission scope, to a downstream API such as Graph,
the Angular app and Web API share the same access rights.</p></li>

<li><p>Logically frontend and backend are distinct components of the
application, created with distinct technologies and with distinct
authorization needs. The two are likely deployed to different Azure
app service instances and reside in different source code repositories
with different life-cycles. Having the two default to sharing an app
registration could be rooted in a time when frontend and backend were
intermingled in a postback-driven app with occasional JavaScript
calls.</p></li>

<li><p>An Angular app may be consuming multiple endpoints: our Web
APIs, Graph, Delve, SharePoint, Exchange. It isn't tied to one API,
except perhaps for the convenience of not having to create an
additional app registration. But with zero monetary cost, there's no
need to be frugal with app registrations.</p></li>

<li><p>App registration metadata differ between an Angular app and a
Web API. Maybe not in a significant way at first, but in time they're
likely to drift further apart. At that point, we must either split the
registration, maybe forcing users to re-consent, or make the single
registration contain the settings of both, if possible.</p></li>

<li><p>By design, the Angular app requires
the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/v1-oauth2-implicit-grant-flow">implicit
grant type</a> (of authorization flow) whereas the Web API doesn't. An
Angular app also requires reply URLs to be setup as part of the
registration whereas the Web API doesn't, and over time the Angular
app will likely access a different set of APIs than any one API. Thus,
an Angular app have registration settings specific to it, meaning it
should have its own app registration.</p></li>

</ul>

<h3>ADAL.js, MSAL.js, and the implicit grant type</h3>

<p>To support our use case, with Angular we're required to use the
<a href="https://github.com/AzureAD/azure-activedirectory-library-for-js">ADAL.js</a>
client authorization library (through
a <a href="https://github.com/benbaran/adal-angular4">wrapper</a> as
with
this <a href="https://github.com/benbaran/adal-angular6-example">example</a>). Despite
inherent security concerns, ADAL.js implements authorization using the
implicit grant type, causing the access token to be transmitted over
an insecure front channel and stored in the browser. Implicit grant
type also doesn't use a refresh token for access token
renewal. Rather, ADAL.js periodically requests a new access from the
authorization endpoint by including in the request a session cookie
previously returned by the authorization server. For as long as the
session cookie is valid, ADAL.js can request new access tokens.

<p>Compare the implicit grant type to
the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/v1-protocols-oauth-code">authorization
code grant type</a> used by the iOS app (implemented
by <a href="https://github.com/AzureAD/azure-activedirectory-library-for-objc">ADAL
for Objective C</a>). Only the authorization grant is transmitted on
the front channel. The iOS app then switches to using a more secure
back channel to connect to the authorization server's token endpoint
to exchange the authorization grant, or refresh token, for the access
token.</p>

<p>As for the choice between ADAL.js
or <a href="https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-js">MSAL.js</a>,
we're forced into the former, and hence limited to the old Azure
Active Directory v1.0 authorization endpoint. To quote
Microsoft's <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/azure-ad-endpoint-comparison">comparison
of v1.0 and v2.0 endpoint capabilities</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
You can use the v2.0 endpoint [with MSAL.js, not ADAL.js]
to <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-app-types#web-apis">build
a Web API that is secured with OAuth 2.0</a>. However, that Web API
can receive tokens only from an application that has the same
Application ID. <b>You cannot access a Web API from a client that has
a different Application ID</b>. The client won't be able to request or
obtain permissions to your Web API.
</blockquote>

<p>It's an inherent limitation in Microsoft's OAuth2 implementation
rather than the OAuth2 standard itself. In our case, we have separate
app registrations for the iOS and Angular apps, causing their
application IDs to differ from that of the Web API.</p>

Active Directory terminology: the authorization server is AAD, client
(Angular app) is an application is AAD, resource server (Web API) is
an application in AAD, resource owner is a user in AAD.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>To support the diverse needs of our three application components,
now and in the future, we end up with three app registrations. For the
iOS and Angular apps to authorize with the Web API, they use the
authorization grant type and implicit grant type, respectively.</p>
