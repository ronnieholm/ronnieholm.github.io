<div id="post">
  <p>
    The other day I came across a problem in system integration with an
    interesting math twist: one-way multi-thread or multi-process synchronize
    records from one system to another. At the source, records are identified by
    sequential
    <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4122">Globally Unique
    Identifier</a>s (GUID) that destination doesn't support. Instead destination
    identifies records by up to 24 alphanumeric characters (0-9, a-z, 36
    symbols) of which at least the first character is reserved for a preamble.
  </p>
  <p>
    The challenge is then how to map a sequential GUID, such
    63b0e1db-cd2f-4265-b4f1-eb4b436b6adf, onto an alphanumeric numeric string,
    while supporting multi-process and multi-threading.
  </p>
  <h3>Encoding a GUID using a larger alphanumeric alphabet</h3>
  <p>
    A GUID in its standard base 16 representation, even without dashes, is 32
    characters, also referred to as digits, or 128 bits in length. Mapping it
    as-is to destination thus isn't an option. But taking advantage of the
    larger base of the alphanumeric alphabet, if we encode it not in base 16 but
    base 36 we can shorten its length.
  </p>  
  <p>
    The relationship between base \(b\), number of digits \(d\), and number of
    states \(s\) is defined by the following equation:

    $$\begin{eqnarray*}
    b^d = s & & \textrm{\{states from base and digits\}}\\
    \log{(b^d)} = \log(s) & & \textrm{\{apply \(\log\) to both sides}\}\\
    d\log(b) = \log(s) & & \textrm{\{apply rule of \(\log(x^y) = y \log(x)\)}\}\\
    d = \dfrac{\log(s)}{\log(b)} & & \textrm{\{divide both sides by \(\log(b)\)}\}
    \end{eqnarray*}$$

    With \(l\) bits available, one may represent up to \(2^l\) states
    \(s\). Reserving one state for zero, the \(l\) bits may represent numbers 0
    through \(2^{l} - 1\) (like in base 10 where two digits represent \(10^2\)
    states or numbers 0 through 99). Since a bit is an indivisible unit, the
    result must be rounded upwards:

    $$d = \left\lceil\dfrac{\log{(2^{l})}}{\log{(b)}}\right\rceil = \left\lceil\dfrac{\log{(2^{128})}}{\log(36)}\right\rceil = \lceil{24.75...}\rceil = 25$$

    As we see, base 36 encoding alone doesn't solve our problem.
  </p>
  <h3>Reserving digits for preamble</h3>
  <p>
    Say we reserve three digits for a preamble, how many bits can we fit into
    the remaining 21 digits when base 36 encoded? To find the answer, we must
    solve for \(l\), and since the bit is an indivisible unit, the result must
    be rounded down:

    $$\begin{eqnarray*}
    \left\lfloor\dfrac{\log(2^l)}{\log(36)}\right\rfloor = 21 & &\\
    \left\lfloor\dfrac{l\log(2)}{\log(36)}\right\rfloor = 21 & & \textrm{\{apply rule of \(\log(x^y) = y \log(x)\)}\}\\    
    l = \left\lfloor\dfrac{21\log(36)}{\log(2)}\right\rfloor & & \textrm{\{multiply and divide}\}\\
    l = \left\lfloor108.56...\right\rfloor = 108 & &
    \end{eqnarray*}$$   

    In other words, 21 digits, base 36 encoded correspond to 108 bits. That's 20
    bits less than the original GUID.
  </p>
  <h3>Making sequential GUIDs random</h3>
  <p>
    The original GUID is
    a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/functions/newsequentialid-transact-sql?view=sqlallproducts-allversions">sequential
    GUID</a>
    whose <a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dbrowne/2012/07/03/how-to-generate-sequential-guids-for-sql-server-in-net">implementation
    details</a> we shouldn't rely on. Worse still, the algorithm for generating
    sequential GUIDs may have changed over time and may change again in the
    future. So which 20 bits to drop without disproportionately increasing the
    risk of a collision?
  </p>
  <p>
    One way to resolve this issue is compute a hash of the original 128
    bits. With <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-1">SHA1</a> for
    instance, regardless of input size, output is always 160 bits. Now instead
    of dropping 20 bits from the original GUID, we drop 52 bits from the
    hash. We can drop any 52 bits as long as we're consistent with which to
    drop; the simplest approach is a bit-wise right-shift by 52 bits.
  </p>
  <p>
    Downside is that because SHA1 is a one-way hash function, and because we're
    dropping bits, mapping becomes a one-way function also. It doesn't matter in
    this case because we can store the original GUID in a separate field inside
    the destination record.
  <p>  
  <h3>Multi-process and multi-threading and possible race conditions</h3>
  <p>
    It seems we could've settled for a simpler scheme and just generated the 108
    bits at random. Unfortunately, this would introduce a race condition into
    the record creation process. Imagine two threads or two processes about to
    create a record at destination. With random bits, each may query for the
    original GUID in a record and get a empty result back. Each then creates the
    record and succeeds. But now destination has two records matching one at
    source. With deterministic IDs only one record is created. The second
    creation attempt will fail, by design.
  </p>
  <h3>Bit lengths and probability of collisions</h3>
  <p>
    Because of hashing and subsequent bit shifting, there's a possibility that
    two source GUIDs could map to the same destination. The more records we
    create, the larger the chance of a collision. From a generalization of
    the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthday_problem">Birthday
    problem</a>, we get that if we have \(n\) records and \(s\) states, the
    approximate probability of a collision becomes (multiply by 100 for
    percentage):

    <!-- High precision calculator: https://keisan.casio.com/calculator 
         1-e^((-1000000^2 / 2^108)) -->
    $$\begin{eqnarray*}
    p(n,s) = 1 - e^{-n^2 / 2^s}\\
    p(10^6,2^{32}) = 1\\
    p(10^6,2^{48}) \sim 3.55\textrm{e-03}\\
    p(10^6,2^{64}) \sim 5.42\textrm{e-08}\\
    p(10^6,2^{108}) \sim 3.08\textrm{e-21}
    \end{eqnarray*}$$   

    Assuming SHA1 hashes are uniformly distributed, even after dropping bits,
    the probability of a collision is infinitesimal. If such black swan event
    does occur, we should at least be able to detect it. Detection is easy as
    the record returned would hold an original GUID different from the one used
    to generate its ID. Depending on the domain, then either the original ID
    must the changed or the collision may be ignored.
  </p>
  <h3>Summary</h3>
  <p>
    We end up with the following equation to describe the mapping. The
    \(\textrm{lpad\(_{21}\)}\) addition ensures the outcome is always 21
    digits. Otherwise, at the extreme, outcome from inner functions may result
    in zero which encoded would become a single zero instead of 21 zeroes:

    $$\begin{eqnarray*}    
    \textrm{map}(\textrm{guid}) = \textrm{lpad\(_{21}\)}(\textrm{encode\(_{36}\)}(\textrm{rshift\(_{52}\)}(\textrm{sha\(_1\)}(\textrm{guid}))))\\
    \textrm{map}(\textrm{63b0e1db-cd2f-4265-b4f1-eb4b436b6adf}) = \textrm{6yucu7i9kj49yjrwu252e}
    \end{eqnarray*}$$ 
    
    If we so desire, we can switch mapping strategy later on. Perhaps
    multi-process or multi-threading is no longer a hard requirement and we can
    switch to the simpler random generated IDs.
