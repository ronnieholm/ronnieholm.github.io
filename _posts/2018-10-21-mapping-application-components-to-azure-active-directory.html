<div id="post">

<p>Deploying a real-world application with components secured
by <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory">Azure
Active Directory</a> (AAD), Azure's AAD app registration page can be a
confusing place. It provides minimal guidance on application types and
how many applications to register. To add to the confusion, many blog
posts focus on simple scenarios and unless one has a good
understanding of
the <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749">OAuth2</a>
and <a href="https://openid.net/developers/specs">OpenID Connect</a>
standards, it's tricky to arrive at a secure and extensible
solution.</p>

<p>From a real-world use case, this post provides guidance on the type
and number of app registrations required to support a secure
architecture. It then details how the use case affects the choice of
client authentication library and the parts of OAuth2 and OpenID
Connect at work to support each component.</p>

<h3>Real-world use case</h3>

<p>Consider the following application implemented as a distributed set
of components:

<ol>
<li><p>An Angular app making secured calls to a custom REST
service.</p>
<li><p>A native iOS app also making secured calls to the same REST
service.</p>
<li><p>An ASP.NET Web API implementing the REST service.</p>
<li><p>ASP.NET Web API making secured calls to MS Graph.</p>
</ol>

<p>All components are secured by AAD, meaning that end-user sign-in to
(1) and (2) happens against AAD and with AAD users and that (3)
receives signed tokens issued by AAD to (1) and (2), and passed along
with calls to (3). (3) similarly requests a signed token and passes it
along with calls to (4).</p>

<p>Reading along, keep in mind that OAuth2 is an authorization
standard. It's OpenID Connect, the layer on top of OAuth2, which
defines authentication. In other words, an OAuth2 access token is
passed along from (1) and (2) to (3) and authorizes that (1) and (2)
can access (3) on the end-user's behalf and with the permissions
consented to by the end-user and possibly an admin user. OpenID
Connect's ID token (see primer on OpenID Connect,
parts <a href="https://developer.okta.com/blog/2017/07/25/oidc-primer-part-1">1</a>, <a href="https://developer.okta.com/blog/2017/07/25/oidc-primer-part-2">2</a>, <a href="https://developer.okta.com/blog/2017/08/01/oidc-primer-part-3">3</a>),
a special kind of access token, is what authenticates an end-user to
(1) and (2). It holds username, full name, and so on, and is never
passed along to (3).</p>

<h3>Types of app registrations</h3>

<p>Creating a new App registration inside the Azure portal, for
application type we have a choice between "Web app/API" and
"Native". The OAuth2 specification, however, names application types
<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-2.1">client
types</a> and outlines three: web application, user-agent-based
application (a fancy term for a browser hosting a JavaScript
application), and native application.</p>

<p>Inside AAD, user-agent-based application maps to "Web app/API"
with <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/reference-app-manifest">oauth2AllowImplicitFlow</a>
turned on in the registration manifest. Turning on
oauth2AllowImplicitFlow adds implicit grant type to the already
supported grant types. Because AAD identifies an app by its client ID,
AAD enables implicit grant type for whatever endpoint the app requests
access to. For iOS and Web API, oauth2AllowImplicitFlow is left turned
off.</p>

<p>From these definitions, it's clear that the iOS app maps to
"Native" and that both Angular and Web API maps to "Web app/API". But
does that mean that Angular and Web API should run under the same
registration?</p>

<h3>Number of app registrations</h3>

<p>Perhaps due to simple use cases, many blog posts share the app
registration between Web API and Angular app. But for anything but the
simplest use cases, reusing an app registration is at best a shortcut
to avoid an additional app registration and at worst a potential
security risk:</p>

<ul>

<li><p>Almost always should the Angular app have its own app
registration. Only in a small, contained Angular app/Web API use case,
where both are designed to only work with each other as one unit,
without integrating with other APIs, is sharing a registration
okay.</p></li>

<li><p>Authorization on a per-application basis doesn't apply with one
app registration shared between Angular app and Web API. With both
having the same client ID and hence the same permissions, to a
downstream API such as Graph, the Angular app and Web API share the
same access rights and are indistinguishable.</p></li>

<li><p>Logically frontend and backend are distinct components of an
application, created with distinct technologies and with distinct
authorization needs. The two are likely deployed to different Azure
app service instances and reside in different source code repositories
with different life-cycles. Having the two share an app registration
is reminiscent of a time when frontend and backend were coupled in a
postback-driven app with occasional JavaScript calls.</p></li>

<li><p>An Angular app may be consuming multiple endpoints: one or more
of our Web APIs and Graph, Delve, SharePoint, or Exchange. It isn't
tied to one API, except perhaps for the convenience of not creating an
additional app registration. While the extra app registration may add
to the mental load, its monetary cost is zero. There's no need to be
frugal with app registrations.</p></li>

<li><p>App registration metadata differ between an Angular app and a
Web API. Maybe not in a significant way at first, but over time
they're likely to drift apart. At that point, we must either split the
registration, maybe forcing users to re-consent, or make the single
registration contain the settings of both, if possible.</p></li>

<li><p>By design, an Angular app requires
the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/v1-oauth2-implicit-grant-flow">implicit
grant type</a> (of authorization flow or method to acquire an access
token) whereas Web API doesn't. An Angular app also requires reply
URLs to be setup as part of the registration (to avoid a rogue app
requesting a token by passing a non-whitelisted reply URL to the
authorization server) whereas a Web API doesn't, and over time an
Angular app will likely access a different set of APIs than any one
Web API. In our use case for instance, only Web API calls MS
Graph. Thus, Angular app and Web API have registration settings
specific to each, meaning they should have separate app
registration.</p></li>

</ul>

<h3>Angular: ADAL.js, MSAL.js, and the implicit grant type</h3>

<p>To support our use case, we're forced into using
<a href="https://github.com/AzureAD/azure-activedirectory-library-for-js">ADAL.js</a>
over <a href="https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-js">MSAL.js</a>
as client authorization library (through
a <a href="https://github.com/benbaran/adal-angular4">wrapper</a> as
with
this <a href="https://github.com/benbaran/adal-angular6-example">example</a>).
To quote
Microsoft's <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/azure-ad-endpoint-comparison">comparison
of v1.0 and v2.0 endpoint capabilities</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
You can use the v2.0 endpoint [with MSAL.js, not ADAL.js]
to <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-app-types#web-apis">build
a Web API that is secured with OAuth 2.0</a>. However, that Web API
can receive tokens only from an application that has the same
Application ID. <b>You cannot access a Web API from a client that has
a different Application ID</b>. The client won't be able to request or
obtain permissions to your Web API.
</blockquote>

<p>It's an inherent limitation in Microsoft's OAuth2 implementation
rather than the OAuth2 standard itself. In our case, we have separate
app registrations for iOS and Angular, causing their application IDs
to differ from that of the Web API.</p>

<p>Despite
known <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-10.16">security
concerns</a>, ADAL.js implements authorization using the implicit
grant type, causing the access token to be transmitted on the less
secure front channel and stored in the browser. The implicit grant
type also doesn't use a refresh token for access token
renewal. ADAL.js periodically requests a new access from the
authorization endpoint by including in the request a session cookie
previously returned by the authorization server. For as long as the
session cookie is valid, ADAL.js can request new access tokens.</p>

<h3>iOS: ADAL for Objective C and the authorization code grant type</h3>

<p>Compare the implicit grant type to
the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/v1-protocols-oauth-code">authorization
code grant type</a> used by the iOS app (implemented
by <a href="https://github.com/AzureAD/azure-activedirectory-library-for-objc">ADAL
for Objective C</a>). Only the short-lived authorization code grant is
transmitted on the front channel by a browser control kicking of the
flow by connecting to the server's authorization endpoint. ADAL
registers
a <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-9">custom
scheme handler</a> (like http or ftp, but app specific and matching
the name setup with AAD) making the app the default for URLs with that
protocol. When the authorization server redirects the browser to
myapp://..., the app receives the code as part of the URL. The app
then switches to using the more secure back channel to connect to the
authorization server's token endpoint to exchange the short lived,
single use authorization code (and later refresh token), for access
and refresh tokens.</p>

<p>Like with the implicit grant, because the authorization code grant
originates from a public client
(see <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-2.1">OAuth2
client types</a>), not even on the back channel does the client
authenticate with the authorization server. Any client in possession
of the code can exchange it for access and refresh tokens. Client
authentication would involve submitting with the code and client ID a
previously agreed upon client secret. But since anyone would be able
to discover the secret of a public client, and it cannot easily be
changed after deployment, public client authentication is
meaningless. Only confidential clients, code running on a server,
authenticate using a secret shared between themselves and the
authorization server.</p>

<p>To convince ourselves that iOS is using the authorization code
grant type, we
can <a href="https://github.com/AzureAD/azure-activedirectory-library-for-objc#diagnostics">turn
on diagnostics logging</a> to see the custom protocol URL and
authorization code and its conversion to tokens. Otherwise, we'd only
know that implicit grant type couldn't have been used because
oauth2AllowImplicitFlow is turned off with the iOS app
registration.</p>

<h3>Web API: MS Graph and the client credentials grant type</h3>

<p>Besides being an AAD secured endpoint, and hence the receiver of
access tokens, Web API itself makes calls to Graph API, another AAD
secured endpoint. It does so by means of
the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/v1-oauth2-client-creds-grant-flow">client
credentials grant type</a>, used by confidential clients for
service-to-service interaction. Without end-user interaction, to the
token endpoint, the Web API submits its client ID, a pre-established
shared client secret (effectively username and password), and the
resource ID of Graph API. In return the token endpoint provides an
access token for the Graph API.</p>

<p>The following use cases require Graph API interaction:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>To lookup security group memberships of the user making a Web
API call. When Angular requests an access token using the implicit
grant type and a user is a member of more than five groups, AAD
substitutes groups claim in ID token and access token with
a <a href="https://github.com/AzureAD/azure-activedirectory-library-for-js/issues/239">hasgroups
claim</a> set to true. It's up to Web API
to <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45501568/azure-jwt-with-property-hasgroups-true-instead-of-groups-property-object">inspect</a>
the hasgroups claim and make a call to Graph API to resolve security
groups. Substitution is due to a limitation in the length of URL by
which the implicit grant type receives tokens. Similar tokens returned
to iOS, through the authorization code grant type and therefore the
response body, aren't subject to the same limitation, and contain a
groups claim, regardless of the number of groups memberships.</p></li>

<li><p>To have Angular or iOS users provide a username and have Web
API resolve it to an ObjectID, the AAD equivalent of
AD's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_Identifier">security
identifier</a>, which is how Web API identifies and stores user
information.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>With AAD, it's possible to grant Angular and iOS applications the
delegated "Read directory data" permissions to lookup security group
members and the ObjectID of any user. That would expose directory
information through a public client, and Web API would still need to
verify that what Angular and iOS claim is true. Using token
validation, claims can be verified, but the response of Graph API
calls made by Angular and iOS cannot. Hence Graph API calls must be
made by Web API.</p>

<h3>Web API: token validation</h3>

<p>With our use case, the Web API is a receiver of access tokens from
the Angular and iOS apps. As such, the Web APIs is responsible for
validating both the token's claims and its signature. Each token
consists of
a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/access-tokens#claims-in-access-tokens">header,
payload, and signature</a>. From the payload, the issuer (iss) claim
must be AAD as defined in the
<a href="https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/.well-known/openid-configuration">OpenID
Connect federation metadata document</a> and the audience (aud) claim,
the intended recipient, must be Web API. As for the token's lifetime,
the not before (nbf) and expiration time (exp) claims must be
valid.</p>

<p>Signature validation must adhere to
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/access-tokens#validating-the-signature">AAD's
key rotation policy</a> stating that</p>

<blockquote>
At any given point in time, Azure AD may sign an id_token [the OpenID
Connect token or an access token] using any one of a certain set of
public-private key pairs. Azure AD rotates the possible set of keys on
a periodic basis, so your app should be written to handle those key
changes automatically. A reasonable frequency to check for updates to
the public keys used by Azure AD is every 24 hours.
</blockquote>

<p>Within the metadata document mentioned above, jwks_uri point to
the <a href="https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/discovery/keys">location</a>
of the <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7517">JSON Web Key
Set</a>, the public keys to verify the signature. Web API must use the
header's algorithm (alg) and Key ID (kid) claims to locate the public
key and perform validation. For all the X509 certificate details, we
can paste the value of each x5c into
an <a href="https://redkestrel.co.uk/products/decoder">online</a>
decoder.</p>

<p><a href="https://developer.okta.com/blog/2018/03/23/token-authentication-aspnetcore-complete-guide">This</a>
post introduces token validation with ASP.NET Core, but not how to
reload metadata on a regular basis. For that we require a periodically
executing method or perhaps the Web API already makes use
of <a href="https://www.hangfire.io">Hangfire</a>. Otherwise, we risk
the Web API failing token validation following
a <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#RotateSigKeys">key
rotation</a> and before the Web API is restarted. Even worse,
validation failure will appear sporadic and will eventually disappear
without intervention.</p>

<p>With on-premise Web API hosting, we can rely
on <a href="https://weblogs.asp.net/owscott/why-is-the-iis-default-app-pool-recycle-set-to-1740-minutes">idle
and periodic app pool restarts</a> to keep metadata up to
date. Although by default the app pool recycles at least every 29
hours, exceeding AAD's 24 hour policy, both periods are
configurable. With Azure App Service, however, running a site in
"Always on"
mode <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21840983/will-always-on-setting-prevent-both-idletimeout-and-periodicrestart">prevents
idle restarts</a> and periodic restarts isn't an IIS but
a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/wcf/feature-details/hosting-in-windows-process-activation-service">WAS</a>
feature, unavailable in Azure.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>To support the diverse needs of our three components, now and in
the future, we ended up with three app registrations. Besides details
of registration, to fully understand what's going on as part of app
authentication and authorization, relevant parts of OAuth2 and OpenID
Connect standards were outlined. Without such knowledge, debugging
amounts to time consuming guess work.</p>
