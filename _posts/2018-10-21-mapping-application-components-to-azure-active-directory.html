<div id="post">
  
<p>Deploying a real-world application with components secured
by <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory">Azure
Active Directory</a> (AAD), Azure's AAD app registration page can be a
confusing place. It provides minimal guidance on application types and
how many applications to register. To add to the confusion, many blog
posts focus on simple scenarios and unless one has a good
understanding of
the <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749">OAuth2</a>
and <a href="https://openid.net/developers/specs">OpenID Connect</a>
standards, it's tricky to arrive at a secure and evolving
solution.</p>

<p>This post provides guidance on the type and number of app
registrations required. It then details how the real-world use cases
affects the choice of client authentication library and the parts of
OAuth2 and OpenID Connect at work. Its focus is on adding perspective
and providing links to hands-on material with diagrams and code, not
on providing a setup guide.</p>

<h3>Real-world use case</h3>

<p>Consider the following application implemented as a distributed set
of components:

<ol>
<li><p>Angular app making secured calls to a custom REST
service.</p>
<li><p>Native iOS app making secured calls to the same REST
service.</p>
<li><p>ASP.NET Web API implementing the REST service.</p>
<li><p>ASP.NET Web API making secured calls to MS Graph.</p>
</ol>

<p>Components secured by AAD, end-users sign-in or authenticate to (1)
and (2) using their AAD credentials and are issued a signed token. (1)
and (2) passed the token with calls to (3) which similarly requests a
signed token and passes it with calls to (4).</p>

<p>Reading along, keep in mind that authorization is orthogonal to
authentication and that authorization requires authentication. OAuth2
is an authorization standard. It's OpenID Connect, the layer on top of
OAuth2 that implements authentication. In other words, (1) and (2)
passing OAuth2 access tokens to (3) <i>authorizes</i> that (1) and (2)
may access (3) on the end-user's behalf, with the permissions
consented to by the end-user and possibly an admin user. The OpenID
Connect ID token (see primer on OpenID Connect,
parts <a href="https://developer.okta.com/blog/2017/07/25/oidc-primer-part-1">1</a>, <a href="https://developer.okta.com/blog/2017/07/25/oidc-primer-part-2">2</a>, <a href="https://developer.okta.com/blog/2017/08/01/oidc-primer-part-3">3</a>),
is what <i>authenticates</i> an end-user to (1) and (2). It holds
username, full name, and the like, but is never passed to (3).</p>

<h3>Types of app registrations</h3>

<p>Creating a new App registration inside the Azure portal, for
application type we have a choice between "Web app/API" and
"Native". These map to the three OAuth2
<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-2.1">client
types</a> of web application, user-agent-based application (a fancy
term for a browser hosting a JavaScript application), and native
application.</p>

<p>With AAD, user-agent-based application maps to "Web app/API"
with <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/reference-app-manifest">oauth2AllowImplicitFlow</a>
turned on in the registration manifest (it doesn't disable other grant
types). Because AAD identifies an app by its client ID, AAD enables
implicit grant type for whatever endpoint the app requests access
to. For iOS and Web API, oauth2AllowImplicitFlow is turned off.</p>

<p>From these definitions, it's clear that the iOS app maps to
"Native" and that both Angular and Web API maps to "Web app/API". But
does that mean that Angular and Web API should run under the same
registration?</p>

<h3>Number of app registrations</h3>

<p>Perhaps due to simple use cases, many blog posts share the app
registration between web service and single page app. For our
real-world use case, reusing the app registration is at best a
shortcut to avoid an additional app registration and at worst a
potential security risk:</p>

<ul>

<li><p>Almost always should the Angular app have its own app
registration. Only in a small, self-contained Angular app + Web API,
designed to only work with each other, without integrating with other
APIs, should the registration be shared.</p></li>

<li><p>Authorization on a per-application basis doesn't apply when
Angular app and Web API share a single app registration. With both
having the same client ID and hence the same permissions, to a
downstream API such as MS Graph, Angular app and Web API share access
rights and are indistinguishable.</p></li>

<li><p>Logically frontend and backend are distinct components of an
application, created with distinct technologies, and with distinct
authorization needs. The two are likely deployed to different Azure
app service instances and reside in different source code repositories
and have separate life-cycles. Having the two share an app
registration is reminiscent of postback-driven apps with occasional
JavaScript.</p></li>

<li><p>An Angular app may be consuming many endpoints: one or more of
our Web APIs and MS Graph, SharePoint, and so on. It isn't necessarily
tied to one API, except for the convenience of not creating an
additional app registration. While the extra app registration might
increase the mental load, its monetary cost is zero. The additional
app registration should be favored as a longer term solution.</p></li>

<li><p>App registration metadata differ between an Angular app and a
Web API. Maybe not in a significant way at first, but over time
they're likely to drift apart. At that point, we must either split the
registration, requiring end-users consent once again or admin consent
on their behalf, or make the single registration contain the settings
of both, if possible.</p></li>

<li><p>By design, an Angular app uses
the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/v1-oauth2-implicit-grant-flow">implicit
grant type</a> (of authorization flow or method of acquiring an access
token) whereas Web API doesn't. An Angular app also requires advance
registration of reply URLs to prevent a rogue app from requesting a
token from AAD and have it sent to its reply URL. Over time an Angular
app will likely access a different set of APIs than any one Web
API. In our use case for instance, only Web API calls MS Graph. Thus,
Angular app and Web API have registration settings specific to each,
meaning they should have separate app registration.</p></li>

</ul>

<h3>Angular: ADAL.js, MSAL.js, and the implicit grant type</h3>

<p>To support our use case, we're forced into using
<a href="https://github.com/AzureAD/azure-activedirectory-library-for-js">ADAL.js</a>
over <a href="https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-js">MSAL.js</a>
as client authorization library (through
a <a href="https://github.com/benbaran/adal-angular4">wrapper</a> as
in
this <a href="https://github.com/benbaran/adal-angular6-example">example</a>).
To quote
Microsoft's <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/azure-ad-endpoint-comparison">comparison
of v1.0 and v2.0 endpoint capabilities</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
You can use the v2.0 endpoint [with MSAL.js, not ADAL.js]
to <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-app-types#web-apis">build
a Web API that is secured with OAuth 2.0</a>. However, that Web API
can receive tokens only from an application that has the same
Application ID. <b>You cannot access a Web API from a client that has
a different Application ID</b> [AAD term for client ID]. The client
won't be able to request or obtain permissions to your Web API.
</blockquote>

<p>It's an inherent limitation with MS' OAuth2 implementation and not
the OAuth2 standard itself. In our case, we have separate app
registrations for iOS and Angular, causing their application IDs to
differ from that of Web API.</p>

<p>Despite
known <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-10.16">security
concerns</a>, ADAL.js implements authorization using the implicit
grant type. The authorization endpoint returns ID token and access
token on the less secure front channel and ADAL.js saves those to
browser storage, available to any JavaScript on the page. Instead of a
refresh token, ADAL.js periodically requests new ID tokens and
on-demand requests new access tokens. A refresh token is by design
longer lived than both ID token and access token and would pose a
security risk if returned with the implicit grant type.</p>

<p>Without prompting the user for login, ADAL.js accomplishes periodic
refresh by adding an invisible iframe element to the DOM, setting its
source to the authorization server token request URL. The request
includes any cookies for the domain, including the authorization
server session cookie (actually a collection of cookies) received
during previous login. The authorization server then directs the
browser, only the page inside the iframe, back to the redirect URL
where ADAL.js checks the response and saves the new ID token to
browser storage. Access token refresh follows the same procedure, but
on-demand, as storing an always valid access token in the browser
would be a security risk. For as long as the authentication server
session cookie is valid, and kept alive, ADAL.js can request new
tokens without user interaction.</p>

<p>We can observe the refresh procedure by keeping the Angular
application idle and Chrome developer tools Network tab open. ADAL.js
has refresh hardcoded to occur every 3,600 seconds, considering the ID
token lifetime of 3,900 seconds.</p>

<h3>iOS: ADAL for Objective C and the authorization code grant type</h3>

<p>Compare the implicit grant type to
the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/v1-protocols-oauth-code">authorization
code grant type</a> used by the iOS app (implemented
by <a href="https://github.com/AzureAD/azure-activedirectory-library-for-objc">ADAL
for Objective C</a>). On the front channel, a browser control
transmits a single use, short-lived authorization code. This works by
ADAL registering
a <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-9">scheme
handler</a> specific to the iOS app and matching the scheme registered
with AAD. When the authorization server redirects the browser control
to myapp://..., the app receives the code as part of the URL. The app
then connects to the authorization server token endpoint over the more
secure back channel and exchanges the authorization code (and later
refresh token), for ID token, access token, and refresh token.</p>

<p>Like with the implicit grant, because the authorization code grant
originates from a public client
(see <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-2.1">OAuth2
client types</a>), not even on the back channel does the client
authenticate with the authorization server. Any client in possession
of the code can exchange it for tokens. Client authentication would
involve submitting with the code and client ID a client secret, shared
between the client and authorization server. But since anyone would be
able to discover the secret of a public client, and it isn't easily
changed after deployment, public client authentication is
pointless. Only a confidential client, code running on a server,
authenticates using a secret.</p>

<p>To convince ourselves that iOS is using the authorization code
grant type, we
can <a href="https://github.com/AzureAD/azure-activedirectory-library-for-objc#diagnostics">turn
on diagnostics logging</a>. Log entries show the scheme, the
authorization code, and its exchange for tokens. Otherwise, we'd only
know that implicit grant type wasn't used because the iOS app
registration has oauth2AllowImplicitFlow turned off.</p>

<h3>Web API: MS Graph and the client credentials grant type</h3>

<p>Besides Web API being an AAD secured endpoint, and hence the
receiver of access tokens, for the requirements below, Web API itself
makes REST calls to MS Graph, another AAD secured endpoint:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>To lookup security group memberships of the authenticated user
making a Web API call. When Angular requests an ID token and access
token using the implicit grant type and the user is a member of more
than (currently) five security groups, AAD by design substitutes the
groups claim for
a <a href="https://github.com/AzureAD/azure-activedirectory-library-for-js/issues/239">hasgroups
claim</a> with a value of true. It's up to Web API
to <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45501568/azure-jwt-with-property-hasgroups-true-instead-of-groups-property-object">inspect</a>
the hasgroups claim and retrieve the user's groups from MS
Graph. (Required delegated or application permissions.)</p></li>

<li><p>To lookup an ObjectID given a username provided by Angular when
a user assigns another access to the app. Within AAD, ObjectID is the
equivalent of an
AD <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_Identifier">security
identifier</a>, i.e., both a GUID by which Web API identifies a user
and a key by which it stores user information. In Web API, we want to
avoid dangling user references when inactive users are removed from
AD. That's why, besides ObjectID, Web API also stores the user's
account and display names. (Requires delegated or application
permissions.)</p></li>

<li><p>To periodically execute non-interactive batch queries against
AAD to identify disabled users. With hundreds of users of the app, a
notification mechanism is needed to re-assign disabled users' active
tasks. Also, time will tell if MS Graph queries triggered by each Web
API request becomes a bottleneck, in which case batch querying or
caching users and groups becomes an option. (Requires application
permissions.)</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Following each need for making MS Graph calls is the permissions
required (actually permission type or grouping as it's the container
for permissions). Application refers to Web API making
service-to-service MS Graph calls with its own identity. Delegated
that Web API makes service-to-service MS Graph calls on behalf of the
signed-in user calling Web API.</p>

<p>Claim substitution occurs due to a limitation in the length of the
URL by which the implicit grant type returns tokens. They come back
Base64 encoded in the URL fragment and the more memberships the larger
the tokens. Tokens returned through the authorization code grant type
aren't subject to the URL length limitation as they're returned in the
response body.</p>

<p>Both application and delegated permissions satisfy two of the
requirements and application only one. Whether to go with fine-grained
permissions and adhering to the principle of least privilege by mixing
application and delegated permissions, or configuring only application
permissions is a matter of preference. The Web API is a confidential
client, both options require admin consent, and application is needed
to satisfy all. Thus, we stick with application and issue MS Graph
calls as Web API, authorized using
the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/v1-oauth2-client-creds-grant-flow">client
credentials grant type</a> (regardless if it's an application or
delegated call, it's still service-to-service).</p>

<p>For Web API to request an access token for MS Graph, it submits to
the token endpoint its client ID, a pre-established shared client
secret, and the resource ID of MS Graph. Had we used delegated
permissions, we'd have to use
the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/v1-oauth2-on-behalf-of-flow">on-behalf-of
grant type</a>. Before calling MS Graph, Web API would have to call
the token endpoint to exchange the user provided access token for one
supporting delegation as
shown <a href="https://joonasw.net/view/azure-ad-on-behalf-of-aspnet-core">here</a>.</p>

<p>Within the Web API app registration setup, under required
permissions, we add MS Graph and enable
<a href="https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/docs/concepts/permissions_r<eference">Read
directory data</a>
under <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/v1-permissions-and-consent">application
permissions</a>.</p>

<h3>Web API: token validation</h3>

<p>With our use case, the Web API is a receiver of access tokens from
the Angular and iOS apps. Each token consists of
a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/access-tokens#claims-in-access-tokens">header,
payload, and signature</a>, and Web API handles both validating claims
and signature. From the payload, the issuer (iss) claim must be our
AAD tenant as defined in the
<a href="https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/.well-known/openid-configuration">OpenID
Connect federation metadata document</a> and the audience (aud) claim,
the intended recipient, must be our Web API. As for the token's
lifetime, the not before (nbf) and expiration time (exp) claims must
be valid.</p>

<p>Signature validation must adhere to
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/access-tokens#validating-the-signature">AAD's
key rotation policy</a>, stating that</p>

<blockquote>
At any given point in time, Azure AD may sign an id_token [the OpenID
Connect token or an access token] using any one of a certain set of
public-private key pairs. Azure AD rotates the possible set of keys on
a periodic basis, so your app should be written to handle those key
changes automatically. A reasonable frequency to check for updates to
the public keys used by Azure AD is every 24 hours.
</blockquote>

<p>Within the metadata document, jwks_uri points to
the <a href="https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/discovery/keys">location</a>
of the <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7517">JSON Web Key
Set</a>, the public keys needed to verify the signature. Defined in
the header's Key ID (kid) claim is key used. For the X509 key details,
such as expiration date, we can paste the value of each x5c into
an <a href="https://redkestrel.co.uk/products/decoder">online</a>
decoder.</p>

<p>To get going with ASP.NET Core token validation,
this <a href="https://developer.okta.com/blog/2018/03/23/token-authentication-aspnetcore-complete-guide">tutorial</a>
and
this <a href="https://github.com/AzureAD/azure-activedirectory-identitymodel-extensions-for-dotnet/issues/1010">Github
issue</a> provide good starting points. Key to robust token validation
is to acknowledge that the authorization server
will <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#RotateSigKeys">rotate
keys</a> and that Web API must check for updated keys. Configuring the
JwtBearer middleware with the metadata discovery URL, it
auto-configures and supports key rotation as well.
</blockquote>

<p>To understand how the JWT middleware supports key rotation, two
pieces are essential: (1)
the <a href="https://github.com/AzureAD/azure-activedirectory-identitymodel-extensions-for-dotnet/blob/master/src/Microsoft.IdentityModel.Protocols/Configuration/ConfigurationManager.cs#L177">ConfigurationManager</a>
class and its GetConfigurationAsync method. The tutorial shows calling
the method in Startup.cs to HTTP GET the metadata discovery URL and
through it the jwks_uri URL. Web API then parses their JSON payloads
and caches those inside ConfigurationManager for one day as per its
default DefaultAutomaticRefreshInterval value, (2)
the <a href="https://github.com/aspnet/Security/blob/master/src/Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer/JwtBearerHandler.cs">JwtBearerHandler</a>
class implementing the JwtBearer middleware calls
GetConfigurationAsync on each token validation. When validation
<a href="https://github.com/aspnet/Security/blob/master/src/Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer/JwtBearerHandler.cs#L111-L119">fails
due to a missing key</a>, the middleware asks ConfigurationManager to
refresh its cache, subject to a default 30 seconds cache duration as
per the DefaultRefreshInterval value.</p>

<p>In other words, logic around DefaultAutomaticRefreshInterval covers
regular key rotation with at least one day notice before use and never
causes token validation to fail. Logic around DefaultRefreshInterval
covers emergency key rotation and does cause token validation to fail
for up to 30 seconds. That's acceptable since old keys are compromised
and the application could be accessible to an unknown third-party.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>To support the diverse needs of our components, now and in the
future, we ended up with three app registrations. Besides registration
details, to fully understand what's going on as part of each
component's authentication and authorization cycle, the post outlined
relevant parts of OAuth2 and OpenID Connect standards. Without such
knowledge, debugging often amounts to time consuming guess work.</p>
