<div id="post">

<p>Deploying a real-world application with components secured
by <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory">Azure
Active Directory</a> (AAD), Azure's AAD app registration page can be a
confusing place. It provides minimal guidance on application types and
how many applications to register. To add to the confusion, many blog
posts focus on simple scenarios and unless one has a good
understanding of
the <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749">OAuth2</a>
and <a href="https://openid.net/developers/specs">OpenID Connect</a>
standards, it's tricky to arrive at a secure and extensible
solution.</p>

<p>From a real-world use case, this post provides guidance on the type
and number of app registrations required to support a secure and
evolving architecture. It then details how the use case affects the
choice of client authentication library and the parts of OAuth2 and
OpenID Connect at work. Its focus is on adding perspective, not to be
a setup guide. Instead, links to setup guides are provided.</p>

<h3>Real-world use case</h3>

<p>Consider the following application implemented as a distributed set
of components:

<ol>
<li><p>Angular app making secured calls to a custom REST
service.</p>
<li><p>Native iOS app also making secured calls to the same REST
service.</p>
<li><p>ASP.NET Web API implementing the REST service.</p>
<li><p>ASP.NET Web API making secured calls to MS Graph.</p>
</ol>

<p>All components are secured by AAD, meaning that end-user sign-in to
(1) and (2) happens against AAD and with AAD users and that (3)
receives signed tokens issued by AAD to (1) and (2), and passed along
with calls to (3). (3) similarly requests a signed token and passes it
along with calls to (4).</p>

<p>Reading along, keep in mind that authorization is orthogonal to
authentication but that authorization requires authentication. OAuth2
is an authorization standard. It's OpenID Connect, the layer on top of
OAuth2, which defines authentication. In other words, an OAuth2 access
token is passed along from (1) and (2) to (3) and authorizes that (1)
and (2) can access (3) on the end-user's behalf and with the
permissions consented to by the end-user and possibly an admin
user. OpenID Connect's ID token (see primer on OpenID Connect,
parts <a href="https://developer.okta.com/blog/2017/07/25/oidc-primer-part-1">1</a>, <a href="https://developer.okta.com/blog/2017/07/25/oidc-primer-part-2">2</a>, <a href="https://developer.okta.com/blog/2017/08/01/oidc-primer-part-3">3</a>),
is what authenticates an end-user to (1) and (2). It holds username,
full name, and so on, but is never passed along to (3).</p>

<h3>Types of app registrations</h3>

<p>Creating a new App registration inside the Azure portal, for
application type we have a choice between "Web app/API" and
"Native". The OAuth2 specification, however, names application types
<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-2.1">client
types</a> and outlines three: web application, user-agent-based
application (a fancy term for a browser hosting a JavaScript
application), and native application.</p>

<p>With AAD, user-agent-based application maps to "Web app/API"
with <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/reference-app-manifest">oauth2AllowImplicitFlow</a>
turned on in the registration manifest. Turning on
oauth2AllowImplicitFlow adds implicit grant type to the already
supported grant types. Because AAD identifies an app by its client ID,
AAD enables implicit grant type for whatever endpoint the app requests
access to. For iOS and Web API, oauth2AllowImplicitFlow is left turned
off.</p>

<p>From these definitions, it's clear that the iOS app maps to
"Native" and that both Angular and Web API maps to "Web app/API". But
does that mean that Angular and Web API should run under the same
registration?</p>

<h3>Number of app registrations</h3>

<p>Perhaps due to simple use cases, many blog posts share the app
registration between Web API and Angular app. But for anything but the
simplest use cases, reusing an app registration is at best a shortcut
to avoid an additional app registration and at worst a potential
security risk:</p>

<ul>

<li><p>Almost always should the Angular app have its own app
registration. Only in a small, contained Angular app/Web API use case,
where both are designed to only work with each other as one unit,
without integrating with other APIs, is sharing a registration
okay.</p></li>

<li><p>Authorization on a per-application basis doesn't apply with one
app registration shared between Angular app and Web API. With both
having the same client ID and hence the same permissions, to a
downstream API such as Graph, the Angular app and Web API share the
same access rights and are indistinguishable. To support delegated
permissions, Web API must implement
the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/v1-oauth2-on-behalf-of-flow">on-behalf-of
grant type</a> which requires separate registrations.</p></li>

<li><p>Logically frontend and backend are distinct components of an
application, created with distinct technologies and with distinct
authorization needs. The two are likely deployed to different Azure
app service instances and reside in different source code repositories
with different life-cycles. Having the two share an app registration
is reminiscent of a time when frontend and backend were coupled in a
postback-driven app with occasional JavaScript calls.</p></li>

<li><p>An Angular app may be consuming multiple endpoints: one or more
of our Web APIs and Graph, Delve, SharePoint, or Exchange. It isn't
tied to one API, except perhaps for the convenience of not creating an
additional app registration. While the extra app registration may add
to the mental load, its monetary cost is zero. There's no need to be
frugal with app registrations.</p></li>

<li><p>App registration metadata differ between an Angular app and a
Web API. Maybe not in a significant way at first, but over time
they're likely to drift apart. At that point, we must either split the
registration, requiring end-users consent once again or admin consent
on their behalf, or make the single registration contain the settings
of both, if possible.</p></li>

<li><p>By design, an Angular app uses
the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/v1-oauth2-implicit-grant-flow">implicit
grant type</a> (of authorization flow or method to acquire an access
token) whereas Web API doesn't. An Angular app also requires reply
URLs to be setup as part of the registration (to avoid a rogue app
requesting a token by passing a non-whitelisted reply URL to the
authorization server) whereas a Web API doesn't, and over time an
Angular app will likely access a different set of APIs than any one
Web API. In our use case for instance, only Web API calls MS
Graph. Thus, Angular app and Web API have registration settings
specific to each, meaning they should have separate app
registration.</p></li>

</ul>

<h3>Angular: ADAL.js, MSAL.js, and the implicit grant type</h3>

<p>To support our use case, we're forced into using
<a href="https://github.com/AzureAD/azure-activedirectory-library-for-js">ADAL.js</a>
over <a href="https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-js">MSAL.js</a>
as client authorization library (through
a <a href="https://github.com/benbaran/adal-angular4">wrapper</a> as
with
this <a href="https://github.com/benbaran/adal-angular6-example">example</a>).
To quote
Microsoft's <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/azure-ad-endpoint-comparison">comparison
of v1.0 and v2.0 endpoint capabilities</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
You can use the v2.0 endpoint [with MSAL.js, not ADAL.js]
to <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-app-types#web-apis">build
a Web API that is secured with OAuth 2.0</a>. However, that Web API
can receive tokens only from an application that has the same
Application ID. <b>You cannot access a Web API from a client that has
a different Application ID</b> [AAD term for client ID]. The client
won't be able to request or obtain permissions to your Web API.
</blockquote>

<p>It's an inherent limitation in MS' OAuth2 implementation and not
the OAuth2 standard itself. In our case, we have separate app
registrations for iOS and Angular, causing their application IDs to
differ from that of the Web API.</p>

<p>Despite
known <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-10.16">security
concerns</a>, ADAL.js implements authorization using the implicit
grant type. Only ID token and access token are returned by the
authorization endpoint on the less secure front channel and stored in
the browser. Instead of a refresh token, ADAL.js periodically requests
new ID tokens and on-demand requests new access tokens. A refresh
token is by design longer lived than both ID token and access token
and would pose a security risk if returned with the implicit grant
type.</p>

<p>Without prompting the user for login, ADAL.js accomplishes periodic
ID token refresh by dynamically adding an invisible iframe element to
the DOM, pointing its source at the authorization endpoint. An
authorization request is submitted, causing any cookies for the domain
to be included. Cookies include the authorization server's session
cookie, actually a collection of cookies, received during previous
login. The authorization server then directs the browser (inside the
iframe) back to the redirect URL. At this point, ADAL.js saves the new
ID token to browser storage. Access token refresh follows the same
procedure, but on-demand, as always valid access tokens stored in the
browser would be a security risk. For as long as the session cookie is
valid, and kept alive, ADAL.js can request new tokens without user
interaction.</p>

<p>Keeping the Angular application idle with having Chrome developer
tools open, we can observe the refresh procedure. ADAL.js has it
hardcoded to occur every 3,600 seconds, considering ID token lifetime
of 3,900 seconds.</p>

<h3>iOS: ADAL for Objective C and the authorization code grant type</h3>

<p>Compare the implicit grant type to
the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/v1-protocols-oauth-code">authorization
code grant type</a> used by the iOS app (implemented
through <a href="https://github.com/AzureAD/azure-activedirectory-library-for-objc">ADAL
for Objective C</a>). Here only a single use, short-lived
authorization code is transmitted on the front channel via a browser
control connected to the authorization server endpoint. ADAL registers
a <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-9">custom
scheme handler</a> with the control. Like http or ftp, but specific to
the iOS app and matching the scheme registered with AAD. When the
authorization server redirects the browser to myapp://..., the app
receives the code as part of the URL. It then switches to using the
more secure back channel to connect to the authorization server's
token endpoint to exchange the authorization code (and later refresh
token), for ID token, access token, and refresh token.</p>

<p>Like with the implicit grant, because the authorization code grant
originates from a public client
(see <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-2.1">OAuth2
client types</a>), not even on the back channel does the client
authenticate with the authorization server. Any client in possession
of the code can exchange it for tokens. Client authentication would
involve submitting with the code and client ID a pre-established
client secret. But since anyone would be able to discover the secret
of a public client, and it cannot easily be changed after deployment,
public client authentication is meaningless. Only a confidential
client, code running on a server, authenticates using a secret shared
between the client and the authorization server.</p>

<p>To convince ourselves that iOS is using the authorization code
grant type, we
can <a href="https://github.com/AzureAD/azure-activedirectory-library-for-objc#diagnostics">turn
on diagnostics logging</a> to see the custom protocol URL and
authorization code and exchange for tokens. Otherwise, we'd only know
that implicit grant type couldn't have been used because
oauth2AllowImplicitFlow is turned off with the iOS app
registration.</p>

<h3>Web API: MS Graph and the client credentials grant type</h3>

<p>Besides Web API being an AAD secured endpoint, and hence the
receiver of access tokens, for the requirements below, Web API itself
makes REST calls to MS Graph, another AAD secured endpoint. Following
each requirement is the permission type required to satisfy
it. Application means that Web API makes service-to-service MS Graph
calls as itself. Delegated that Web API makes service-to-service MS
Graph calls on behalf of the signed-in user calling Web API:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>To lookup security group memberships of the user making a Web
API call. When Angular requests an ID token and access token using the
implicit grant type and the user is a member of more than (currently)
five security groups, AAD by design substitutes the groups claim for
a <a href="https://github.com/AzureAD/azure-activedirectory-library-for-js/issues/239">hasgroups
claim</a> with a value of true. It's up to Web API
to <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45501568/azure-jwt-with-property-hasgroups-true-instead-of-groups-property-object">inspect</a>
the hasgroups claim and retrieve the user's security groups from MS
Graph. (Required delegated or application permission.)</p></li>

<li><p>To lookup the ObjectID of a username provided by Angular or
iOS, such as when one user assigns another user access to a part of
the app. Within AAD, ObjectID is the equivalent of an
AD <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_Identifier">security
identifier</a>, i.e., a GUID by which Web API identifies the user and
a key by which it stores user information. If the user is removed from
AAD, the app shouldn't end up with a dangling reference. Besides
ObjectID, it stores the user's display name as well. (Requires
delegated or application permission.)</p></li>

<li><p>To periodically execute non-interactive batch queries against
AAD to identify disabled users. With hundreds of users of the app, a
notification mechanism is needed, showing disabled users and their
active tasks that may require re-assignment. Also, if AAD queries
triggered by each Web API request turn out to be a bottleneck, batch
querying or caching group memberships may be an option, too. (Requires
application permission.)</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Claim substitution is due to a limitation in the length of the URL
by which the implicit grant type transmits tokens. Tokens come back
base 64 encoded in a URL fragment and more memberships leads to a
larger token. Tokens returned through the authorization code grant
type aren't subject to the URL length limitation. They're transmitted
within the response body and therefore contain a groups claim,
regardless of the number of memberships.</p>

<p>Two of the requirements may be satisfied by either application or
delegated permission type and one only by application. Whether to
setup fine-grained access and mix application and delegated types is a
matter of preference. Mixing means sticking to the principle of least
privilege. On the other hand, both require admin consent, the Web API
is a confidential client, and it requires application permission
anyway. To keep the setup manageable, we collectively define every MS
Graph call as made on Web API's behalf, authorized using
the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/v1-oauth2-client-creds-grant-flow">client
credentials grant type</a> (regardless if it's an application or
delegated call, it's still service-to-service).</p>

<p>The Web API submits to the token endpoint its client ID, a
pre-established shared client secret (effectively username and
password), and the resource ID of MS Graph. In return the token
endpoint provides an access token for MS Graph. Had we used delegated
permissions, we'd have to use
the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/v1-oauth2-on-behalf-of-flow">on-behalf-of
grant type</a> for the delegated calls. Before calling MS Graph, Web
API would have to call the token endpoint to exchange the user
provided access token for one supporting delegation as
shown <a href="https://joonasw.net/view/azure-ad-on-behalf-of-aspnet-core">here</a>,
complicating Web API logic.</p>

<p>In terms of setup, within the Web API app registration, under
required permissions, we add MS Graph and enable its
<a href="https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/docs/concepts/permissions_r<eference">Read
directory data</a> as
an <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/v1-permissions-and-consent">application
permission</a>.</p>

<h3>Web API: token validation</h3>

<p>With our use case, the Web API is a receiver of access tokens from
the Angular and iOS apps. As such, the Web APIs is responsible for
validating both the token's claims and its signature. Each token
consists of
a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/access-tokens#claims-in-access-tokens">header,
payload, and signature</a>. From the payload, the issuer (iss) claim
must be our AAD tenant as defined in the
<a href="https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/.well-known/openid-configuration">OpenID
Connect federation metadata document</a> and the audience (aud) claim,
the intended recipient, must be our Web API. As for the token's
lifetime, the not before (nbf) and expiration time (exp) claims must
be valid.</p>

<p>Signature validation must adhere to
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/access-tokens#validating-the-signature">AAD's
key rotation policy</a> stating that</p>

<blockquote>
At any given point in time, Azure AD may sign an id_token [the OpenID
Connect token or an access token] using any one of a certain set of
public-private key pairs. Azure AD rotates the possible set of keys on
a periodic basis, so your app should be written to handle those key
changes automatically. A reasonable frequency to check for updates to
the public keys used by Azure AD is every 24 hours.
</blockquote>

<p>Within the metadata document mentioned above, jwks_uri point to
the <a href="https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/discovery/keys">location</a>
of the <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7517">JSON Web Key
Set</a>, the public keys to verify the signature. Web API must use the
header's algorithm (alg) and Key ID (kid) claims to locate the public
key and perform validation. For X509 key details, such as expiration
date, we can paste the value of each x5c into
an <a href="https://redkestrel.co.uk/products/decoder">online</a>
decoder.</p>

<p>This <a href="https://developer.okta.com/blog/2018/03/23/token-authentication-aspnetcore-complete-guide">tutorial</a>
introduces token validation with ASP.NET Core, but not how to reload
metadata on a regular basis. For that we must implement a periodically
executing method or use <a href="https://www.hangfire.io">Hangfire</a>
or similar. Otherwise, we risk Web API failing token validation
following
a <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#RotateSigKeys">key
rotation</a> and before next Web API restart. Even worse, validation
failure will appear sporadic and eventually resolve itself.</p>

<p>With on-premise Web API hosting, we can rely
on <a href="https://weblogs.asp.net/owscott/why-is-the-iis-default-app-pool-recycle-set-to-1740-minutes">idle
and periodic app pool restarts</a> to keep metadata up to
date. Although by default the app pool recycles at least every 29
hours, exceeding AAD's 24-hour policy, both periods are
configurable. With Azure App Service, running a site in "Always on"
mode <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21840983/will-always-on-setting-prevent-both-idletimeout-and-periodicrestart">prevents
idle restarts</a> and periodic restarts isn't an IIS but
a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/wcf/feature-details/hosting-in-windows-process-activation-service">WAS</a>
feature, unavailable in Azure.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>To support the diverse needs of our three components, now and in
the future, we ended up with three app registrations. Besides details
of registration, to fully understand what's going on as part of app
authentication and authorization, relevant parts of OAuth2 and OpenID
Connect standards were outlined. Without such knowledge, debugging
often amounts to time consuming guess work.</p>
