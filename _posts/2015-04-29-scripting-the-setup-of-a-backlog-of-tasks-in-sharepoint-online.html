<p>
The first part of this post describes the backlog I like to use when
working with clients and the rationale behind it. On SharePoint
projects, I tend to implement it as a SharePoint list -- otherwise a
spreadsheet is a decent fallback. If for no other reason, storing it
in SharePoint helps display some of the capabilities of SharePoint
which clients may be unaccustomed to. The second part of this post
outlines an approach to automate the setup of the backlog since I use
it across multiple clients. It relies on the scripting using the
SharePoint client side object model.
</p>

<h2>Motivation</h2>

<p>
Oftentimes clients don't have a process (backed by tooling) in place
for tracking a backlog of tasks. The default is then to gravitate
toward mail, which is anything but transparent and structured. With a
host of sites providing free tracking tools, a SharePoint list (or
spreadsheet for that matter) may seem overly simplistic. But when all
you need is a simple system to track a backlog of task, and ensure
it's visible to everyone, it's good enough. The goal isn't to adhere
to a formal process such
as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(software_development)">Scrum</a>, 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban">Kanban</a>,
or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITIL">ITIL</a>, but to solely
focus on <a href="http://www.ustream.tv/recorded/61492206">minimizing
lead time to business impact by striving for predictability</a>. The
bells and whistles and knobs and dials of dedicated tools may inhibit
one's ability to keep focus on this goal.
</p>

<p>
To be specific, here's a screenshot of what an item in my backlog
looks like:

</p>

<p>A couple of supporting remarks on the design and use of the
backlog:</p>

<ul>
<li>
It's based on the build-in GenericList rather than the IssueTracking
list template because I prefer extending lists rather than trying to
figure out how the IssueTracking template is configured and how to
remove undesired functionality.
</li>
<li>
I strive for as few modifications to the Generic list as
possible. Just enough fields and views to satisfy the basic needs of a
backlog as I don't want to leave anyone with the impression that it's
a fully-fledged task tracker. For situations not covered by the common
task structure, I fall back to using append-only Comments.
</li>
<li>
For Description and Acceptance criteria, I like to follow the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior-driven_development">Behavior-driven
development (BDD)</a>-style and elaborate with regular
prose. Following the BDD template, perhaps in concert with
the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5_Whys">Five Whys
technique</a>, there's a higher propability the right questions get
asked upfront to balance both business and technical interests.
</li>
<li>
The intension of Business priority is for the business responsible to
prioritize tasks by providing a relative priority. Parties from
multiple areas of business may add to the backlog and thus Business
priority should be viewed in conjunction with Area to create as many
orderings as there're areas.
</li>
<li>
Only I add items to the backlog to prevent it from evolving into an
unmanageable to-do list and to ensure all items are properly
qualified. Otherwise items tend to get added in the spur of the
moment, lacking steps to reproduce and what qualifies as done or the
business rationale. I tend to write up a proposal backlog item and ask
the business responsible to confirm before going ahead. The business
responsible should only modify Business priority, Status, and
Comments.
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Scripting the backlog</h2>

<p>
It may be hard to recall exactly how the backup was point-and-click
setup in a previous environment, even if we still have access to the
environment. One possible solution to not having to remember
everything would be saving the original backlog as a template and
importing in into a new environment. I dislike this approach because
setup becomes opaque and the template cannot necessarily be imported
across versions of SharePoint. Another solution is to document setup,
but that's a duplicate effort usually resulting in a stale document.
My preferred solution for re-creating artefacts across SharePoint
environments is scripting. It makes the setup transparent and makes
local adjustments easier.
</p>

<p>
Let's start by established a container to insert code the main
scripting logic into. This script uses the client side object model
and is intended to be run against SharePoint Online. It can be adapted
for on-prem by replacing to the SetupContext logic.

<p>
While it may seem like a lot of code, it's mostly standard SharePoint
Online authentication logic and generation of XML adjusted for
variations in field types and available properties. The XML can be
extracted from SharePoint by first configuring the field through a
regular browser and then use a tool
like <a href="http://spcb.codeplex.com">SharePoint 2013 Client
Browser</a> to browse the list definition.
</p>

<p>
With the container in place, now we can fill it with the actual
script:
</p>

<pre class="prettyprint lang-cs">
var backlog = ctx.Web.Lists.Add(new ListCreationInformation {
    Title = "BugfreeConsultingBacklog",
    TemplateType = (int)ListTemplateType.GenericList
});

ctx.Load(backlog, l => l.Fields, l => l.DefaultView);
backlog.Title = "Bugfree Consulting Backlog";
backlog.EnableVersioning = true;
backlog.Update();
ctx.ExecuteQuery();

new[] {
    CreateNoteField("Description", "Description"),
    CreateNoteField("AcceptanceCriteria", "Acceptance criteria"),
    CreateNumberField("BusinessPriority", "Business priority"),
    CreateChoiceField("Classification", "Classification", new[] { "Change", "Defect" }, ""),
    CreateTextField("Area", "Area"),
    CreateUserField("AssignedTo", "Assigned to"),
    CreateUserField("BusinessContact", "Business contact"),
    CreateChoiceField(
        "Status", 
        "Status", 
        new[] { 
            "Received", 
            "Needs clarification", 
            "Ready for development", 
            "Under development", 
            "Development completed", 
            "Blocked", 
            "Ready for test", 
            "Test succeeded", 
            "Test failed", 
            "Completed", 
            "Closed" 
        },
        "Received"),
    CreateNumberField("OriginalEstimate", "Original estimate"),
    CreateNumberField("RemainingEstimate", "Remaining estimate"),
    CreateNoteField("Comments", "Comments", true),
}
.ToList()
.ForEach(schema => backlog.Fields.AddFieldAsXml(schema.ToString(), false, AddFieldOptions.DefaultValue));
ctx.ExecuteQuery();

var comments = ctx.CastTo<FieldMultiLineText>(backlog.Fields.GetByTitle("Comments"));
ctx.Load(comments);
ctx.ExecuteQuery();
comments.AppendOnly = true;
comments.Update();
                
backlog.DefaultView.DeleteObject();
ctx.ExecuteQuery();

var newView = backlog.Views.Add(new ViewCreationInformation {
    Title = "AllItems",
    ViewFields = new[] { 
        "ID", "LinkTitle", "Area", "AssignedTo", "Classification", 
        "BusinessPriority", "Status", "OriginalEstimate", "RemainingEstimate"
    },
    SetAsDefaultView = true,
    Paged = true
});
newView.Title = "All Items";
newView.Update();
ctx.ExecuteQuery();
</pre>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>
As developers we should use the tools and notations we're most
accustomed to to create an executable specification for setting up the
backlog across different SharePoint environments -- in essence the
client side object model provides an internal domain specific language
for defining SharePoint artefacts. We shouldn't fall back to opaque
template definitions or ambiguous documents outlining the setup just
because SharePoint provides that option. It would be akin to a SQL
server administration not using SQL scripts for manipulating a
database.
