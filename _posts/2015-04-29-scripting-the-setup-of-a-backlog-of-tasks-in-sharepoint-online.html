<div id="post">

<p>
The first part of this post describes the backlog format I typically
use with clients and the rationale behind it. On SharePoint projects,
I tend to implement the backlog as a SharePoint list. If for no other
reason, storing it in SharePoint may help drive adoption of both the
backlog and SharePoint. The second part of this post outlines
automating backlog setup in a new environment. I use the backlog
across multiple clients and prefer scripting its setup using
SharePoint's client side object model.
</p>

<h2>Motivation</h2>

<p>
In many cases, clients don't have a process and tooling in place for
tracking a backlog of tasks. The default tool is mail, which is
anything but transparent and structured. In today's world of free
tools, a SharePoint list (or spreadsheet for that matter) may seem
overly simplistic. But when all you need is a simple way to track
tasks and communicate their state, I find a SharePoint list to be
sufficient. The goal isn't to adhere to a formal process, such
as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(software_development)">Scrum</a>,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban">Kanban</a>,
or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITIL">ITIL</a>, but
to <a href="http://www.ustream.tv/recorded/61492206">minimizing lead
time to business impact by striving for predictability</a>. The bells
and whistles and knobs and dials of specialized tools can easily cause
one to lose sight of this goal.
</p>

<p>
here's a screenshot of what an item in my backlog looks like:

</p>

<p>A couple of remarks on the design and intended use of the
backlog:</p>

<ul>
<li>
It's based on the build-in GenericList template rather than the
build-in IssueTracking one. I prefer extending the basic list over
trying to figure out how the advanced one is configured and how to
remove unused functionality.
</li>
<li>
I strive for as few additions to the GenericList as possible. Just
enough fields and views to satisfy the basic needs of a backlog. I
don't want to leave anyone with the impression that it's a
fully-fledged task tracker. For cases not fitting the basic entry
structure, I fall back on the append-only Comments.
</li>
<li>
For Description and Acceptance criteria, I like to follow the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior-driven_development">Behavior-driven
development (BDD)</a>-style and elaborate with regular
prose. Following the BDD template, perhaps in concert with
the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5_Whys">Five Whys
technique</a>, there's a higher propability the right questions get
asked upfront to balance both business and technical interests.
</li>
<li>
The intension of Business priority is for the business responsible to
prioritize tasks by providing a relative priority. Parties from
multiple areas of business may add to the backlog and thus Business
priority should be viewed in conjunction with Area to create as many
orderings as there're areas.
</li>
<li>
Only I add items to the backlog to prevent it from evolving into an
unmanageable to-do list and to ensure all items are properly
qualified. Otherwise items tend to get added in the spur of the
moment, lacking steps to reproduce and what qualifies as done or the
business rationale. I tend to write up a proposal backlog item and ask
the business responsible to confirm before going ahead. The business
responsible should only modify Business priority, Status, and
Comments.
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Scripting the backlog</h2>

<p>
It may be hard to recall exactly how the backup was point-and-click
setup in a previous environment, even if we still have access to the
environment. One possible solution to not having to remember
everything would be saving the original backlog as a template and
importing in into a new environment. I dislike this approach because
setup becomes opaque and the template cannot necessarily be imported
across versions of SharePoint. Another solution is to document setup,
but that's a duplicate effort usually resulting in a stale document.
My preferred solution for re-creating artefacts across SharePoint
environments is scripting. It makes the setup transparent and makes
local adjustments easier.
</p>

<p>
Let's start by established a container to insert code the main
scripting logic into. This script uses the client side object model
and is intended to be run against SharePoint Online. It can be adapted
for on-prem by replacing to the SetupContext logic.

}
</pre>

<p>
While it may seem like a lot of code, it's mostly standard SharePoint
Online authentication logic and generation of XML adjusted for
variations in field types and available properties. The XML can be
extracted from SharePoint by first configuring the field through a
regular browser and then use a tool
like <a href="http://spcb.codeplex.com">SharePoint 2013 Client
Browser</a> to browse the list definition.
</p>

<p>
With the container in place, now we can fill it with the actual
script:
</p>

<pre class="prettyprint lang-cs">
var backlog = ctx.Web.Lists.Add(new ListCreationInformation {
    Title = "BugfreeConsultingBacklog",
    TemplateType = (int)ListTemplateType.GenericList
});

ctx.Load(backlog, l => l.Fields, l => l.DefaultView);
backlog.Title = "Bugfree Consulting Backlog";
backlog.EnableVersioning = true;
backlog.Update();
ctx.ExecuteQuery();

new[] {
    CreateNoteField("Description", "Description"),
    CreateNoteField("AcceptanceCriteria", "Acceptance criteria"),
    CreateNumberField("BusinessPriority", "Business priority"),
    CreateChoiceField("Classification", "Classification", new[] { "Change", "Defect" }, ""),
    CreateTextField("Area", "Area"),
    CreateUserField("AssignedTo", "Assigned to"),
    CreateUserField("BusinessContact", "Business contact"),
    CreateChoiceField(
        "Status", 
        "Status", 
        new[] { 
            "Received", 
            "Needs clarification", 
            "Ready for development", 
            "Under development", 
            "Development completed", 
            "Blocked", 
            "Ready for test", 
            "Test succeeded", 
            "Test failed", 
            "Completed", 
            "Closed" 
        },
        "Received"),
    CreateNumberField("OriginalEstimate", "Original estimate"),
    CreateNumberField("RemainingEstimate", "Remaining estimate"),
    CreateNoteField("Comments", "Comments", true),
}
.ToList()
.ForEach(schema => backlog.Fields.AddFieldAsXml(schema.ToString(), false, AddFieldOptions.DefaultValue));
ctx.ExecuteQuery();

var comments = ctx.CastTo<FieldMultiLineText>(backlog.Fields.GetByTitle("Comments"));
ctx.Load(comments);
ctx.ExecuteQuery();
comments.AppendOnly = true;
comments.Update();
                
backlog.DefaultView.DeleteObject();
ctx.ExecuteQuery();

var newView = backlog.Views.Add(new ViewCreationInformation {
    Title = "AllItems",
    ViewFields = new[] { 
        "ID", "LinkTitle", "Area", "AssignedTo", "Classification", 
        "BusinessPriority", "Status", "OriginalEstimate", "RemainingEstimate"
    },
    SetAsDefaultView = true,
    Paged = true
});
newView.Title = "All Items";
newView.Update();
ctx.ExecuteQuery();
</pre>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>
As developers we should use the tools and notations we're most
accustomed to to create an executable specification for setting up the
backlog across different SharePoint environments -- in essence the
client side object model provides an internal domain specific language
for defining SharePoint artefacts. We shouldn't fall back to opaque
template definitions or ambiguous documents outlining the setup just
because SharePoint provides that option. It would be akin to a SQL
server administration not using SQL scripts for manipulating a
database.
