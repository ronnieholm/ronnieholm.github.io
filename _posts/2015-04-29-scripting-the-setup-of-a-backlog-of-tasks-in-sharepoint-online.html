<div id="post">

<p>
The first part of this post describes the backlog format I typically
use with clients and the rationale behind it. On SharePoint projects,
I tend to implement the backlog as a SharePoint list. If for no other
reason, storing it in SharePoint may help drive adoption of both the
backlog and SharePoint. The second part of this post outlines
automating backlog setup in a new environment. I use the backlog
across multiple clients and prefer scripting its setup using
SharePoint's client side object model.
</p>

<h2>Motivation</h2>

<p>
In many cases, clients don't have a process and tooling in place for
tracking a backlog of tasks. The default tool is mail, which is
anything but transparent and structured. In today's world of free
tools, a SharePoint list (or spreadsheet for that matter) may seem
overly simplistic. But when all you need is a simple way to track
tasks and communicate their state, I find a SharePoint list to be
sufficient. The goal isn't to adhere to a formal process, such
as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(software_development)">Scrum</a>,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban">Kanban</a>,
or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITIL">ITIL</a>, but
to <a href="http://www.ustream.tv/recorded/61492206">minimizing lead
time to business impact by striving for predictability</a>. The bells
and whistles and knobs and dials of specialized tools can easily cause
one to lose sight of this goal.
</p>

<p>
here's a screenshot of what an item in my backlog looks like:

</p>

<p>A couple of remarks on the design and intended use of the
backlog:</p>

<ul>
<li>
It's based on the build-in GenericList template rather than the
build-in IssueTracking one. I prefer extending the basic list over
trying to figure out how the advanced one is configured and how to
remove unused functionality.
</li>
<li>
I strive for as few additions to the GenericList as possible. Just
enough fields and views to satisfy the basic needs of a backlog. I
don't want to leave anyone with the impression that it's a
fully-fledged task tracker. Thus, for cases not fitting the basic
format, I default to less-structured append-only Comments.
</li>
<li>
For Description and Acceptance criteria, I like to follow the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior-driven_development">Behavior-driven
development (BDD)</a>-style and elaborate with regular
prose. Following BDD, perhaps in concert with
the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5_Whys">Five Whys
technique</a>, I find there's a higher propability of asking the right
questions upfront to help balance business and technical aspects.
</li>
<li>
Business priority is an integer intended for business responsibles to
prioritize tasks within their Area relative to each other. Thus,
overall task priority may be determined by combining Business priority
with Area.
</li>
<li>
Only I may add new tasks to the backlog to prevent it from evolving
into an unmanageable to-do list with unqualified items added in the
spur of the moment. In practice, I write task proposals based on mail
or verbal dialog with business responsibles and ask for confirmation
before going ahead. A business responsible should only have to modify
Business priority, Status, and Comments.
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Scripting the backlog</h2>

<p>
Relying on a point and click approach to backlog setup makes
remembering the steps involved hard, even with access to an existing
backlog. One alternative would be saving the original backlog as a
template and importing in into a new environment. I dislike this
approach because steps is equally opaque. Another alternative would be
to document the setup with screenshots and prose, but that's a
duplicate effort, usually resulting in stale documentation. Instead, I
prefer scripting. It makes setup transparent and makes for easier
local adjustments.
</p>

<p>
Let's start scripting by creating a container for the main scripting
logic to go into. This script relies on the SharePoint client side
object model and is intended to be run against SharePoint Online, but
can be adapted for on-prem by replacing the SetupContext logic.

}

<p>
While it may seem like a lot of code, it's mostly standard SharePoint
Online authentication logic and generation of XML adjusted for
variations in field types and available properties. The XML can be
extracted from SharePoint by first configuring the field through a
regular browser and then use a tool
like <a href="http://spcb.codeplex.com">SharePoint 2013 Client
Browser</a> to browse the list definition.
</p>

<p>
With the container in place, now we can fill it with the actual
script:
</p>

<pre class="prettyprint lang-cs">
var backlog = ctx.Web.Lists.Add(new ListCreationInformation {
    Title = "BugfreeConsultingBacklog",
    TemplateType = (int)ListTemplateType.GenericList
});

ctx.Load(backlog, l => l.Fields, l => l.DefaultView);
backlog.Title = "Bugfree Consulting Backlog";
backlog.EnableVersioning = true;
backlog.Update();
ctx.ExecuteQuery();

new[] {
    CreateNoteField("Description", "Description"),
    CreateNoteField("AcceptanceCriteria", "Acceptance criteria"),
    CreateNumberField("BusinessPriority", "Business priority"),
    CreateChoiceField("Classification", "Classification", new[] { "Change", "Defect" }, ""),
    CreateTextField("Area", "Area"),
    CreateUserField("AssignedTo", "Assigned to"),
    CreateUserField("BusinessContact", "Business contact"),
    CreateChoiceField(
        "Status", 
        "Status", 
        new[] { 
            "Received", 
            "Needs clarification", 
            "Ready for development", 
            "Under development", 
            "Development completed", 
            "Blocked", 
            "Ready for test", 
            "Test succeeded", 
            "Test failed", 
            "Completed", 
            "Closed" 
        },
        "Received"),
    CreateNumberField("OriginalEstimate", "Original estimate"),
    CreateNumberField("RemainingEstimate", "Remaining estimate"),
    CreateNoteField("Comments", "Comments", true),
}
.ToList()
.ForEach(schema => backlog.Fields.AddFieldAsXml(schema.ToString(), false, AddFieldOptions.DefaultValue));
ctx.ExecuteQuery();

var comments = ctx.CastTo<FieldMultiLineText>(backlog.Fields.GetByTitle("Comments"));
ctx.Load(comments);
ctx.ExecuteQuery();
comments.AppendOnly = true;
comments.Update();
                
backlog.DefaultView.DeleteObject();
ctx.ExecuteQuery();

var newView = backlog.Views.Add(new ViewCreationInformation {
    Title = "AllItems",
    ViewFields = new[] { 
        "ID", "LinkTitle", "Area", "AssignedTo", "Classification", 
        "BusinessPriority", "Status", "OriginalEstimate", "RemainingEstimate"
    },
    SetAsDefaultView = true,
    Paged = true
});
newView.Title = "All Items";
newView.Update();
ctx.ExecuteQuery();
</pre>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>
As developers we should use the tools and notations we're most
accustomed to to create an executable specification for setting up the
backlog across different SharePoint environments -- in essence the
client side object model provides an internal domain specific language
for defining SharePoint artefacts. We shouldn't fall back to opaque
template definitions or ambiguous documents outlining the setup just
because SharePoint provides that option. It would be akin to a SQL
server administration not using SQL scripts for manipulating a
database.
