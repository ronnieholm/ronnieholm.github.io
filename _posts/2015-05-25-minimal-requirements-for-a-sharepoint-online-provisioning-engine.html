<div id="post">

<p>This post outlines a minimal set of requirements for an artefact
provisioning engine. In broad terms, such engine is any piece of
software which creates and applies changes to state over
time. Examples include doing database migrations or upgrading
configuration files with new releases of a piece of software. The
example I use throughout this post is that of a SharePoint Online
provisioning engine. Its task is to create and query site collections,
webs, document libraries, views, pages, and the like in a safe and
reliable manner.
</p>

<h2>Guiding principles</h2>

<p>Inspired by
the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_pattern">Command</a>
and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command%E2%80%93query_separation#Command_Query_Responsibility_Segregation">Command
Query Responsibility Segregation</a> patterns, the main organizing
principle behind the SharePoint Online provisioning engine is the
grouping of functionality into reusable commands and
queries. Commands, such as create site collection, create list, and
add web part to page, are allowed to read and write to SharePoint
whereas queries, such as a recursive web visitor, are read-only.
</p>

<p>For commands to be truly reliable and reusable, they must have the
properties listed below. Queries being read-only are simpler and can
get away with being idempotent and composable.</p>

<h3>Idempotent</h3>

<p>Executing the same command or query against an artefact more than
once must not change the result beyond the initial application. For
instance, attempting to create a list more than once should only
result in a single instance of the list being created.</p>

<h3>Additive</h3>

<p>Executing a command must not delete or overwrite user created
structure or content, unless of course it's an explicit delete
command. For this to work, each provisioned artefact must be uniquely
identifiable. For instance, lists, views, and web parts have a title,
and content types have a name. </p>

<p>Applying non-additive updates to SharePoint artefacts is
particularly challenging as users are outright encouraged to change
both structure and content. Contrast this with the work involved in
updating a SQL database whose structure remains constant in between
upgrades.</p>

<p>Non-additive updates should be small and localized to avoid
undesired side effects, and should be delegated to separate run-once
scripts. As a corollary, once an artefact has been updated (or failed
an update), we never roll back. Instead we roll forward by creating
new run-once scripts.</p>

<h3>Composable</h3>

<p>More complex commands or queries are composed from simpler ones ad
infinitum. In order for each to not interfere with the other, or have
a certain imposed ordering, commands and queries must be as
self-contained as possible. Performance considerations may require a
small amount of shared state, such as the client context.</p>

<p>As an example, suppose we want to provision an instance of the Acme
Corp project site collection template. We'd create a top-level
CreateAcmeCorpProjectSiteCollection command and compose it from
smaller commands as illustrated below. These smaller commands come in
two flavors: the general ones which are independent of any Acme Corp
provisioning and the specific ones which encapsulate Acme Corp
business logic.</p>

<pre>
CreateAcmeCorpProjectSiteCollection (specific)
  CreateSiteCollection (generic)
  CreateContentType (generic)
  CreateAnalysisWeb (specific)
    CreateWeb (generic)
    CreateAcmeDocumentLibrary (specific)
      CreateList (generic)
      AddColumn (generic)
      AddView (generic)
  CreateDesignWeb (specific)
  ...
</pre>

<p>In object oriented terms, each command and query is modelled as a
class with an Execute method, accepting parameters specific to its
functioning. The CreateSiteCollection command, for instance, is passed
the title, URL, template, size, and language and in turn passes it
along to the CSOM site collection creation API. As for the body of the
Execute method, it's
a <a href="http://martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/transactionScript.html">transaction
script</a>, calling out to other commands.</p>

<p>In order to provision artefacts in the right order, the
provisioning engine does a depth-first traversal of the dependency
tree. This ordering translates nicely to the call stack metaphor.</p>

<h2>Comparison with PnP provisioning engine</h2>

<p>As of current,
a <a href="http://wp.sjkp.dk/sharepoint-site-provisioning-engine">number
of provisioning engines exist</a> with
the <a href="https://github.com/OfficeDev/PnP-Provisioning-Schema">PnP
engine</a>
(<a href="https://github.com/OfficeDev/PnP/tree/master/OfficeDevPnP.Core/OfficeDevPnP.Core/Framework/Provisioning">source</a>)
probably getting the most attention.</p>

<p>The PnP engine is heavily dependent on XML and a mapping of
properties from CSOM to XML and back. As the two evolve, maintaining
both feature parity and backward compatibility seems
challenging. Being XML-based, the PnP engine has to parse XML into an
abstract syntax tree and, while traversing the tree, call the CSOM API
and possible custom plugins. It would seem to introduce a considerable
amount of accidental complexity.</p>

<p>While I like the idea of a shared provisioning engine, I opt for
being closer to the metal and not rely on XML as an external domain
specific language. I'm more developer-focused and prefer expressing
the template in code and take advantage of Visual Studio's
refactoring, compiler, and debugging support. Taking the long view on
maintainability, I'm not convinced that having users define templates
is such a good idea.</p>

<p>My developer-centric approach focuses on state transitions leading
to some end state, whereas the PnP approach focuses on declaratively
defining the end state. I rely on loops (and
<a href="/blog/2011/11/13/a-table-driven-approach-to-creating-sharepoint-sites-with-powershell/">table-driven
code</a>), helper methods, and other programming constructs to
configure artefacts. In principle nothing precludes having the same
constructs available in XML. That's the philosophy of MSBuild and
NAnt.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>In this post I outlined what I consider core requirements for a
developer-centric SharePoint Online provisioning engine. It describes
an engine that have been in production for a few months, creating site
collections from quite involved templates. As I was finishing the
engine, the PnP one started gaining tracktion. I chose to continue
down my own path, however, because of PnP's XML-based nature.</p>
