<div id="post">

<p>Sample code available
for <a href="https://github.com/ronnieholm/Bugfree.Spo.Cqrs">download</a>
from Github.</p>

<p>This post outlines a minimal set of requirements for a
developer-centric artefact provisioning engine. In broad terms, such
engine is any piece of software which creates and applies changes to
state over time. Examples include doing database migrations or
upgrading configuration files with new releases of a piece of
software. The example I use throughout this post is that of a
SharePoint Online provisioning engine which I've recently developed
and put into production. Its task is to create and query site
collections, webs, document libraries, views, pages, and the like in a
safe and reliable manner.
</p>

<h2>Guiding principles</h2>

<p>Inspired by
the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_pattern">Command</a>
and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command%E2%80%93query_separation">Command
Query Responsibility Segregation</a> patterns, the main organizing
principle behind the SharePoint Online provisioning engine is the
grouping of functionality into reusable commands and
queries. Commands, such as create site collection, create list, and
add web part to page, are allowed to read and write to SharePoint
whereas queries, such as a recursive web visitor or get search engine
result, are read-only.
</p>

<p>For commands to be truly reliable and reusable, they must adhere to
the properties below. Queries being read-only are simpler and can get
away with only being idempotent and composable.</p>

<h3>Idempotent</h3>

<p>Executing the same command or query against an artefact more than
once must not change the result beyond the initial application. For
instance, attempting to create a list more than once should only
result in a single instance being created.</p>

<h3>Additive</h3>

<p>Executing a command must not delete or overwrite user created
structure or content, unless of course it's an explicit delete
command. For this to work, each provisioned artefact must be uniquely
identifiable. For instance, lists, views, and web parts have a title,
and content types have a name to identify those by.</p>

<p>Applying non-additive updates to SharePoint artefacts is
particularly challenging as users are outright encouraged to change
both structure and content. Contrast this with updating an SQL
database whose structure at least remains constant in between
upgrades. Then add the SharePoint factor.</p>

<p>Non-additive updates should be small and localized to avoid
undesired side effects, and should be delegated to separate run-once
scripts. As a corollary, once an artefact has been updated (or failed
an update), I never roll back. Instead I roll forward by creating new
run-once scripts.</p>

<h3>Composable</h3>

<p>More complex commands or queries are composed from simpler ones ad
infinitum. In order for one to not interfere with the other, or have
an imposed ordering, commands and queries must be as self-contained as
possible. Performance considerations, however, may require a small
amount of shared state, such as the client context.</p>

<p>As an example, suppose I want to provision an instance of the Acme
Corp project site collection template. Then I'd create a top-level
CreateAcmeCorpProjectSiteCollection command and compose it from
smaller commands as illustrated below. These smaller commands come in
two flavors: the general ones which are independent of any Acme Corp
provisioning and the specific ones which encapsulate Acme Corp
business logic.</p>

<pre>
CreateAcmeCorpProjectSiteCollection (specific)
  CreateSiteCollection (generic)
  CreateContentType (generic)
  CreateAnalysisWeb (specific)
    CreateWeb (generic)
    CreateAcmeDocumentLibrary (specific)
      CreateList (generic)
      AddColumn (generic)
      AddView (generic)
  CreateDesignWeb (specific)
  ...
</pre>

<p>In object oriented terms, each command and query is modelled as a
class with an Execute method, accepting parameters specific to its
functioning. The CreateSiteCollection command, for instance, is passed
the title, URL, template, size, and language and in turn passes it
along to the CSOM site collection creation API. As for the body of the
Execute method, in this case and in general, it's
a <a href="http://martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/transactionScript.html">transaction
script</a> calling out to commands and queries.</p>

<p>To ensure artefacts get provisioned in the correct dependency
order, the provisioning engine does a depth-first traversal of the
above tree. This ordering maps nicely to the call stack metaphor.</p>

<h2>Comparison with PnP provisioning engine</h2>

<p>As of current,
a <a href="http://wp.sjkp.dk/sharepoint-site-provisioning-engine">number
of provisioning engines exist</a> with
the <a href="https://github.com/OfficeDev/PnP-Provisioning-Schema">PnP
engine</a>
(<a href="https://github.com/OfficeDev/PnP/tree/master/OfficeDevPnP.Core/OfficeDevPnP.Core/Framework/Provisioning">source</a>)
probably getting the most attention.</p>

<p>The PnP engine is heavily dependent on XML and a mapping of
properties from CSOM to XML and back. As the two evolve, maintaining
feature parity and backward compatibility seems challenging. Being
XML, the PnP engine has to parse it into an abstract syntax tree and,
while traversing the tree, call the CSOM API and possible custom
extensions. That too seems to introduce a considerable amount of
accidental complexity.</p>

<p>While I like the idea of a shared provisioning engine, I opt for
being closer to the metal and not rely on XML as an external domain
specific language. I'm developer-centric and prefer expressing the
template in code and take advantage of Visual Studio's refactoring,
compiler, and debugging support. Taking the long view on
maintainability, I'm not convinced that users defining templates
through point and click and an engine exporting those verbatim as XML
is such a good idea.</p>

<p>Another key difference is that my developer-centric provisioning
engine focuses on state transitions leading to some end state, whereas
the PnP engine focuses on declaratively defining the end state. I rely
on loops (and
<a href="/blog/2011/11/13/a-table-driven-approach-to-creating-sharepoint-sites-with-powershell/">table-driven
code</a>), helper methods, and other typical programming constructs to
configure artefacts. In principle nothing precludes having the same
constructs available in the XML. That's partly the philosophy of
MSBuild and NAnt.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>In this post I outlined what I consider the minimal requirements
for a developer-centric SharePoint Online provisioning engine. The
ideas stem from an engine that I've had in production for a few
months, creating site collections from fairly involved templates. As I
was wrapping up my engine, the PnP engine had started getting
headlines. I chose to continue down my path, however, because it takes
a more developer-centric view on provisioning.</p>
