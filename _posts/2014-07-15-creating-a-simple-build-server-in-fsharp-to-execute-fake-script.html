<div id="post">

<p>Now that
we have <a href="http://bugfree.dk/blog/2014/04/28/using-fsharp-and-fake-to-build-a-sharepoint-provider-hosted-app/">created
a FAKE script</a> to check out the latest code from TFS, build it, and
deploy it to IISExpress, the next step is to run the script at regular
intervals to ensure the build stays in good shape. We could use TFS
for this by installing a build agent on a local server or install
another build server.</p>

<p>Alternatively, we could write a simple build server ourselves. We
really don't need anything fancy like statistics and build
notification. A simple mail notification with the log file
attached and a summary in the mail body whenever the build fails will
do.</p>

<p>For the CiServer.fsx script, first we need to set various
configuration options:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint lang-ml">
open System
open System.IO
open System.Diagnostics
open System.Threading
open System.Net
open System.Net.Mail
open System.Text
open System.Collections.Generic

let mailFrom = "foo@bugfree.dk"
let mailTo = ["bar@bugfree.dk"; "baz@bugfree.dk"]
let smtpServer = "smtp.gmail.com"
let smtpUsername = mailFrom
let smtpPassword = "password"
let failureSummaryLength = 30
let maxBuildDuration = 1000 * 60 * 10
let timeBetweenBuilds = 1000 * 60 * 15
let fakeExe = __SOURCE_DIRECTORY__ + "/packages/FAKE.2.15.4/tools/fake.exe"
</pre>

<p>As we want CiServer to send a mail notification upon build failure,
we need to configure the outgoing SMTP server. The mailTo allows for
the specification of a list of recipients to mail when the build
fails, including in the mail the last failureSummaryLength lines of
the build output. These lines often suffice to fix the build without
having to look at the complete log file.</p>

<p>Since we want CiServer to spawn Fake.exe, we need to ensure
Fake.exe doesn't get stuck for whatever reason, i.e., we want to
terminate the build if it takes longer than maxBuildDuration. We also
want to run the build in an infinite loop with timeBetweenBuilds
between one build finishes and the next build starting.</p>

<p>Now for the crux of the CiServer:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint lang-ml">
let formatOutput message =
    sprintf "%s: %s" (DateTime.Now.ToString("MM-dd-yyyy HH:mm:ss")) message

let logToConsole message =
    message |> formatOutput |> printfn "%s"

let output = List<string>()
let logToFile message =
    message |> output.Add

let build() =
    let nl = Environment.NewLine
    let p = 
        new Process(
            StartInfo = 
                ProcessStartInfo(
                    FileName = fakeExe, 
                    Arguments = __SOURCE_DIRECTORY__ + "/Build.fsx deploy",
                    UseShellExecute = false,
                    RedirectStandardOutput = true,
                    RedirectStandardError = true))

    let logOutput (e: DataReceivedEventArgs) = 
        logToConsole e.Data
        logToFile e.Data

    p.OutputDataReceived.Add(logOutput)
    p.ErrorDataReceived.Add(logOutput)
    p.Start() |> ignore
    p.BeginOutputReadLine()
    p.BeginErrorReadLine()

    let exited = p.WaitForExit(maxBuildDuration)
    p.CancelOutputRead()
    p.CancelErrorRead()
    if not exited then logToConsole "Maximum build time exceeded. Build killed"

    if p.ExitCode <> 0 then
        logToConsole "Build failed. Sending mail" 
        let tail = 
            output 
            |> Seq.skip(output.Count - min failureSummaryLength output.Count)
            |> Seq.reduce (fun acc s -> acc + nl + s)

        use message = 
            new MailMessage(
                From = MailAddress(mailFrom),
                Subject = "AcmeApp build failure",
                Body = "See attachment for complete build log." + nl + nl +
                       "Below is the last part of the build log:" + nl + nl +
                       tail)
        mailTo |> List.iter (fun r -> message.To.Add(MailAddress(r)))
        let bytes = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(String.Join(nl, output))
        message.Attachments.Add(new Attachment(new MemoryStream(bytes), "Log.txt"))
        (new SmtpClient(
            Host = smtpServer,
            Credentials = NetworkCredential(smtpUsername, smtpPassword),
            EnableSsl = true)).Send(message)
</pre>

<p>The build function is what spawns the Fake process and attaches a
listener to its standard error and standard output. What Fake targets
print while they execute typically go to standard output while any
errors in the build report go to standard error.</p>

<p>To make the build run in an infinite loop, we need to add the
following piece of code to the end of the script. Because it's outside
a function, it's executed immediately:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint lang-ml">
while true do
    logToConsole "Build started"
    build()
    logToConsole "Build ended. Going to sleep"
    Thread.Sleep(timeBetweenBuilds)
</pre>

<p>To invoke the CiServer, we open a console window, navigate to the
folder holding the CiServer.fsx script and execute it. Within my
project, this script is located at the root of the solution, next to
the solution file:</p>

<pre>
PS> .\packages\FAKE.2.15.4\tools\Fsi.exe .\CiRunner.fsx
</pre>

<p>Now the CiServer executes the deploy target of
the <a href="http://bugfree.dk/blog/2014/04/28/using-fsharp-and-fake-to-build-a-sharepoint-provider-hosted-app">aforementioned</a> Fake build file at regular intervals and notifies a list
of recipients of build failures. On every iteration of the loop, the
Fake script runs regardless of any code changes. One improvement would
be to query TFS, using one of its many web services, if any code was
checked in since the last run.</p>

<p>On my previous project of five developers, this simple build server
was suffient for our needs.</p>
