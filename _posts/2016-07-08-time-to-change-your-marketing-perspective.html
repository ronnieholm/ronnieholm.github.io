<div id="post">

<p>I much enjoy listening to
the <a href="http://developeronfire.com">Developer On Fire</a> show,
and
found <a href="http://developeronfire.com/episode-142-philip-morgan-sharing-hard-learned-lesson">episode
142</a> with <a href="https://philipmorganconsulting.com/">Philip
Morgan</a> especially relevant. Its topic is marketing, something that
many developers view as spin, hype, or deception. Done right, however,
marketing is a way to help clients understand what you do. A way to
position yourself and have direction in your career.</p>

<p>The show centers on the somewhat counter-intuitive notion that to
fill one's pipeline, a narrow focus is better than a wide
focus. Instead of mindlessly attending networking events to make
connections, there's a more effective way to fill your pipeline.</p>

<p>Some points that I think are worth keeping in mind:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>We as developers tend to think of our experience within
  software development as riding a rocket ship up. Compared to other
  professions, we aren't used to things not going so well.</p></li>

<li><p>Don't avoid to do marketing, and depend on others to bring you
  work, just because you don't know how to do it. As
  tech-professionals we tend to think it's all about technologies, and
  that when focusing on our expertise, clients magically appear for
  the service we provide.</p></li>

<li><p>Specializing is better than generalizing. Having many skills
  across a wide spectrum gives a false sense of security. For
  instance, being a generalist technical writer, you may think that
  you can do anything related to writing. While that may be true,
  generalist skills produce a low-value value proposition to potential
  clients. Knowing a lot about a lot of things means your skillset
  isn't focused enough to provide dramatic value in a single
  area.</p></li>

<li><p>Instead of spending most of your time thinking about your
  skillset, your personality, and how that makes your business
  different, think more about things from the perspective of the
  client, and what creates value for them. Instead of being easy to
  get along with, flexible, and so on, there's more value to be
  delivered by going deep into a topic.</p></li>

<li><p>Use the notion of how much value it creates for clients as a
  world view within which you evaluate decisions. If the value of
  something is more self-evident, it's also easier to sell. Instead of
  getting clients excited about the means by which results are
  produced, get them excited about the results themselves.</p></li>

<li><p>Freelancing is a relationship business. The irony is that many
  who get into these areas aren't actually so great at relationships
  and will have to figure it out. As a freelancer, the relationships
  are your most valuable assets or currency.</p></li>

<li><p>Think of positioning as a Venn diagram with two circles. One
  circle is the things you can do, your skills. The other circle is
  the things your clients need, the things that they may be willing to
  pay top dollar for. Clients not in the sense of working for now, but
  those that in the future you could get access to. Is there a part of
  your skills that you don't think is that sexy, important, or
  interesting that actually is in the intersection? If there's an
  overlap, this represents your business' ideal market position. And
  be aware that a large part of your skills will be outside that
  intersection. Don't stop doing those things, but shift marketing
  focus to talk about the things that clients value.</p></li>

<li><p>Another way of thinking about positioning is to gradually
  increase the value you deliver to clients by becoming more focused
  over time. Because you've specialized, as you go deeper, it'll
  unlock new ways for you to create value for clients. As you
  understand your clients business better, you see something that
  needs a technical person to find new ways to deliver value.</p></li>

<li><p>With marketing, focus on that one thing that we can lead with
  and open a door to get somebody's attention. Once that one thing has
  done its job, how can we then build a relationship over time that
  delivers regular, steady value to clients so they understand our
  depth, capabilities, and strengths, and think of us when they have a
  need. Done right, marketing can be a vehicle for increasing
  trust.</p></li>

<li><p>Stay deep in the problem domain by doing pro-bono micro
  consults. If someone comes to you with a problem that you can't help
  with over email, offer to get on the phone free for 30
  minutes.</p></li>

<li><p>Don't think of narrowing your marketing focus as a high-stakes,
  low-certainty decision where you risk going down the wrong path and
  painting yourself in a corner by picking the wrong specialty. In
  reality it's a process, something that's iterative.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>In conclusion, being narrow or wide isn't a binary, but rather a
continuum which may need constant adjustment. In any event, make sure
the give
