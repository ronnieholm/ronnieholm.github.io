Part 4: Analyzing the memory dump with WinDbg (future)
</p>

<p>A client has reported that their web farm running SharePoint 2007
(effectively ASP.NET, MS SQL Server, and associated services) has been
going offline each night for the past couple of months. In this post
I'll document the steps that went into troubleshooting the issue. As
it's a fairly long process, it'll take a few posts to arrive at the
root cause. We'll start by collecting precise timing data on the
farm's uptime and downtime and then correlate these measurements with
server logs. From there we'll switch to using DebugDiag and WinDbg to
narrow down the cause.</p>

<h4>Collecting uptime/downtime measurements</h4>

<p>First order of business is talking to the affected internal
users. They consistently report that when navigating to the intranet,
Internet Explorer keeps showing a blank page while the loader wheel
within the tab bar spins for minutes (forever). The page remains
blank, which indicates that the web server never gets to deliver
content to the client. Users also report that the farm is down every
night and gives a rough range of the downtime.</p>

<p>I want to collect more accurate timing to see if a pattern emerges:
how long is the farm down? How many servers in farm are affected? How
many Internet Information Services (IIS) web applications are
affected?  Since no existing monitoring system had been in place for
the past couple of months, I rolled my own simple tool. While it isn't
enterprise grade monitoring, it's plenty sufficient for the case in
hand.</p>

<p>My monitoring tool uses HTTP heartbeat monitoring as a proxy for
farm uptime and downtime. It's comprised of the following C#
program:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint lang-cs">
using System;
using System.Net;
using System.Threading;

// Usage examples:
// ./HttpHeartbeat interval url
// ./HttpHeartbeat 5 http://dtu.dk/images/modules/socialmedia/twitter_small.png | tee dtu.txt
// ./HttpHeartbeat 30 http://intranet.acme.dk/org/it/pages/default.aspx | tee intranet.txt
// ./HttpHeartbeat 30 http://projects.acme.dk/pages/default.aspx | tee project.txt

namespace HttpHeartbeat {
    class Program {
        static void Main(string[] args) {
            // Present custom NTLM credential to the web server. Otherwise, the credential
            // with which the tool is running is used. It may not provide access to URL.
            var credential = new NetworkCredential("admin", "secret", "acme.dk");
            var cache = new CredentialCache();
            cache.Add(new Uri("http://intranet.acme.dk"), "NTLM", credential);
            cache.Add(new Uri("http://projects.acme.dk"), "NTLM", credential);

            var run = 0;
            while (true) {
                using (var wc = new WebClient()) {
                    wc.Credentials = cache;
                    wc.Proxy = WebRequest.DefaultWebProxy;
                    Console.Write($"{++run} {DateTime.Now} ");
                    try {
                        var s = wc.DownloadString(args[1]);
                        Console.WriteLine(string.IsNullOrEmpty(s) ? "Empty" : "OK");
                    } catch (Exception e) {
                        Console.WriteLine(e.Message);
                    }
                }
                Thread.Sleep(int.Parse(args[0]) * 1000);
            }
            Console.WriteLine();
        }
    }
}
</pre>

<p>Every n'th second, the HttpHeartbeat tool attempts to establish a
connection with an endpoint and fetch the content of a URL. The tool
is well-suited for execution in a PowerShell terminal using the tee
cmdlet. It simultaneously writes output to the console and a file for
later analysis.</p>

<p>I setup HttpHeartbeat to run across a host of machines: on a
reference laptop on the local network and on key servers that are part
of the farm. These servers typically resolve intranet.acme.dk to
127.0.0.1 (by way of their hosts file). Thus, running HttpHeartbeat
directly on a server, fetching a page on the intranet from there,
causes the request to be processed by the local server's web
stack. That way I can determine if most or all servers are affected
and root out issues with the network between the farm and client. When
the browser is showing an empty page, it may just as well be a network
issue. As for the reference laptop, its requests pass through a load
balancer.</p>

Web front-end server 1: 
    07-07-2017 22:48:03 to 08-07-2017 06:47:04
    08-07-2017 22:47:25 to 09-07-2017 00:03:47

    12-07-2017 22:46:32 to 13-07-2017 00:09:55
    No further heartbeats collected as user was logged out

Web front-end server 2: 
    07-07-2017 22:47:24 to 08-07-2017 06:48:35
    08-07-2017 22:47:25 to 09-07-2017 00:03:47

Search application server (intra-farm communication: resolves intranet.acme.dk to Web front-end server 2):
    07-07-2017 22:47:55 to 08-07-2017 06:47:25
    08-07-2017 22:47:02 to 09-07-2017 00:04:56
    No further heartbeats collected as user was logged out

Management application server: 
    07-07-2017 22:47:24 to 08-07-2017 06:47:41
    08-07-2017 22:47:25 to 09-07-2017 00:03:17
    09-07-2017 22:46:40 to 10-07-2017 00:17:43
    No further heartbeats collected as user was logged out

<p>The output reveals an interesting pattern. The reference laptop and
every server in the farm running HttpHeartbeat show roughly identical
uptimes and downtimes. The difference in time can likely be ascribed
to the 30 second heartbeat detection interval and that it takes some
time until heartbeat detection reports failure. I've aggregated the
tool's output above. In the log files, "The operation has timed out"
is what shows up for almost every heartbeat request within the
downtime period.</p>

<p>Next I setup an additional heartbeat target on the reference
laptop. I'm fetching a page within the projects web application. I ran
the heartbeat pings on the reference laptop only, assuming the results
generalize to servers as well. Pinging another web application (of
which the servers have about 16 each) in the farm, I want to see if
the issue is isolated to a single web application or every IIS web
application.</p>

<pre>
Reference laptop: 
    11-07-2017 00:55:26 to 11-07-2017 00:59:46
    12-07-2017 00:55:16 to 12-07-2017 00:59:36
    13-07-2017 00:55:36 to 13-07-2017 01:02:06
</pre>

<p>On the first night, because downtime was so brief, I thought it was
maybe just a glitch. Subsequent nights do reveal a pattern,
however. The projects web application goes down at a later point in
time compared to the intranet web application, and it stays down for a
shorter time as well.</p>

<h4>Conclusion</h4>

<p>When all servers in a farm goes down at roughly the same time, and
stays down for roughly the same duration of time, it indicates that
the issue isn't with any particular server. More likely, the downtime
is due to some shared component that each server requires in order to
operate: a SharePoint component, Active Directory, MS SQL Server, SAN,
and so on.</p>

underlying causes.</p>
