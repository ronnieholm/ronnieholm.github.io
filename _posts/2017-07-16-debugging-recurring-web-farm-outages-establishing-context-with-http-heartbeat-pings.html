<p>A client has reported that their web farm running SharePoint 2007
(effectively ASP.NET, MS SQL Server, and associated services) has been
going offline each night for the past couple of months. In this post
we'll document the steps taken to troubleshoot the issue. As it's a
fairly long process, it'll take a few posts to arrive at the root
cause. We'll start by collecting precise timing data on the farm's
uptime and downtime and correlate these measurements with server
logs.</p>

<h3>Collecting uptime/downtime measurements</h3>

<p>First order of business is talking to the affected internal
users. They consistently report that when browsing the intranet,
Internet Explorer shows a blank page with the tab loader wheel
spinning for minutes (forever). The page remains blank, indicating
that the web server never responded to the client. Users also report
that the farm is down every night at around 23.00, lasting for 90 to
120 minutes.</p>

<p>We want to collect more accurate timing to see if a pattern
emerges: how long is the farm actually down? How many servers in farm
are affected? How many Internet Information Services (IIS) web
applications are affected? Since no monitoring system is in place, we
roll our own. While not enterprise grade, is plenty sufficient for the
case at hand.</p>

<p>Our monitoring tool employs HTTP heartbeat monitoring as a proxy
for farm uptime and downtime:</p>

namespace HttpHeartbeat {
    class Program {
        static void Main(string[] args) {
            // Present custom NTLM credential to the web server. Otherwise, the credential
            // with which the tool is running is used. It may not provide access to URL.
            var credential = new NetworkCredential("admin", "secret", "acme.dk");
            var cache = new CredentialCache();
            cache.Add(new Uri("http://intranet.acme.dk"), "NTLM", credential);
            cache.Add(new Uri("http://projects.acme.dk"), "NTLM", credential);

            var run = 0;
            while (true) {
                using (var wc = new WebClient()) {
                    wc.Credentials = cache;
                    wc.Proxy = WebRequest.DefaultWebProxy;
                    Console.Write($"{++run} {DateTime.Now} ");
                    try {
                        var s = wc.DownloadString(args[1]);
                        Console.WriteLine(string.IsNullOrEmpty(s) ? "Empty" : "OK");
                    } catch (Exception e) {
                        Console.WriteLine(e.Message);
                    }
                }
                Thread.Sleep(int.Parse(args[0]) * 1000);
            }
            Console.WriteLine();
        }
    }
}
</pre>

<p>Every nth second, HttpHeartbeat attempts to establish a connection
with an endpoint and fetch its content. The tool is well-suited for
execution in a PowerShell terminal using
the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/Microsoft.PowerShell.Utility/Tee-Object">tee
cmdlet</a>. It simultaneously outputs to the console and a file for
later analysis.</p>

<p>We setup HttpHeartbeat to run across a host of machines: on a
reference laptop on the local network and on key servers in the
farm. These servers typically resolve intranet.acme.dk to 127.0.0.1
(by way of their hosts file). Thus, running HttpHeartbeat against
intranet.acme.dk on these servers, the request is processed by the
local server's web stack. That way we can determine if most or all
servers are affected and rule out issues with the network between the
client and farm. As for the reference laptop, its requests pass
through a load balancer.</p>

<p>Here's the aggregated output from running the tool, showing
downtime per server:</p>

<p>Running HttpHeartbeat reveals an interesting pattern: the reference
laptop and every server detect roughly identical uptimes and
downtimes. The slight difference in time is likely due to the 30
second heartbeat interval and the time it takes to detect a
failure. Across the log files, "The operation has timed out" shows up
for almost every heartbeat request within the downtime period.</p>

<p>Next, we setup an additional heartbeat target on the reference
laptop, fetching a page within another web application. We ran the
heartbeat pings on the reference laptop only, assuming the results
generalize to servers as well. Pinging another web application, of
which the farm has 16, we want to see if the issue is isolated to a
single web application or multiple/every IIS web application.</p>

<pre style="overflow: auto; word-wrap: normal; white-space: pre;">
Reference laptop: 
    11-07-2017 00:55:26 to 11-07-2017 00:59:46
    12-07-2017 00:55:16 to 12-07-2017 00:59:36
    13-07-2017 00:55:36 to 13-07-2017 01:02:06
</pre>

<p>On the first night, because downtime is so brief, it's hard to tell
if what we see is actual downtime. Subsequent nights, however, reveal
a pattern. The projects.acme.dk web application is offline a little
later than intranet.acme.dk web application, and is offline for
shorter time as well.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>When all servers in a farm go offline at about the same time, and
stays down for roughly the same duration, it indicates that the issue
isn't with a particular server. More likely, the downtime is due to
some shared component that each server depends on in order to operate:
Active Directory, MS SQL Server, SAN, and the like.</p>

to the underlying cause.</p>
