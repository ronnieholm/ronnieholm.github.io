    I'm currently making my way
    through <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ray-Tracing-Weekend-Minibooks-Book-ebook/dp/B01B5AODD8">Ray
    tracing in One Weekend</a> (now also available for
    <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/14yayBb9XiL16lmuhbYhhvea8mKUUK77W">free</a>)
    and its 500 lines
    of <a href="https://github.com/petershirley/raytracinginoneweekend">C++
    code</a>. Being a bit rusty on the math side, these posts serve as
    my notes and supplement the book.
  </p>  
  <p>
    In this post I focus on the mechanics of 2D line-circle
    intersection. This technique is required in order to trace a ray
    from the eye, or camera position, through a pixel on the screen,
    or image plane, and into the scene. As the ray travels through the
    scene, we want to determine whether it hits, or intersects with,
    the circle, or scene object, and if so at which positions. These
    positions determines the image plane's color at that pixel.
  </p>
  <p>
    I start out with line-circle intersections in 2D because it's
    simpler to visualize and because once the scalar math is worked
    out, it generalizes nicely to 3D and vector math. To develop a
    visual intuition for the math, I found it helpful to play with the
    equations in
    <a href="http://wolframalpha.com">Wolfram Alpha</a>
    and <a href="https://www.desmos.com/calculator">similar</a> sites.
  </p>
  <p>
    In 3D space, the process is nicely illustrated in the Wikipedia
    article
    on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_tracing_(graphics)">ray
    tracing</a>.

    For a gentle introduction to the topic of ray tracing, I recommend
    watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frLwRLS_ZR0">Disney's
    short Practical Guide to Path Tracing</a> and the

  <h3>Circle centered around origin</h3>
  <p>
    A circle may be defined in terms of the position of its center and
    its radius. To start simple, assume the circle is centered around
    the origin at \((0,0)\). In this case, the circle equation, or
    circle on standard form as it's also called, is:

    $$x^2 + y^2 = r^2$$

    The way to read the circle equation is that for any \((x,y)\), if
    \(x^2 + y^2 = r^2\) holds true, then the point is on the circle,
    otherwise it's not. The circle equation follows from the
    Pythagorean theorem, or distance formula. In order to visualize
    the relationship between the circle equation and the Pythagorean
    theorem, consider a point \((x,y)\) on the circle shown below:
  </p>
  <p>
    <img src="/content/circle-equation.gif" width="350px"/>
  </p>
  <p>
    For this right-sided triangle, \(\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} = r\) holds
    true. By squaring both sides we get rid of the square root and end
    up with the circle equation.
  </p>

  <h3>Circle offset from origin</h3>
  <p>
    Instead of a circle centered at \((0,0)\), it may be centered at
    any point \((c_x, c_y)\):
    
    $$\begin{eqnarray*}
    (x - c_x)^2 + (y - c_y)^2 = r^2 & & \textrm{or} & & \sqrt{(x - c_x)^2 + (y - c_y)^2} = r
    \end{eqnarray*}$$
    
    As an example, imagine the circle's center being to the right and
    up with respect to origin. For the circle equation to still hold
    true, \((x,y)\) points on the circle must have greater values of
    \(x\) and \(y\) than when the circle was centered at origin.
  </p>
  <p>
    To keep the following examples short, they assume the circle is
    centered at \((0,0)\) such that \(c_x\) and \(c_y\) from the
    circle equation may be ignored.
  </p>

  <h3>Circle from point on circle</h3>
  <p>
    Circle equation in hand, if provided with a point \((x,y) =
    (-3,4)\) on a circle, and assuming the circle is centered around
    origin, the circle equation can be determined:

    $$\begin{eqnarray*}
    x^2 + y^2 = r^2\\
    (-3)^2 + 4^2 = r^2\\
    9 + 16 = r^2\\
    5 = r
    \end{eqnarray*}$$

    meaning this circle's equation is
    
    $$x^2 + y^2 = 5^2$$
  </p>

  <h3>Points inside, on, or outside circle</h3>
  <p>
    Comparing the distance of a point to the center of a circle
    defined by \(x^2 + y^2 = 5^2\), any point may be determined as
    either inside, outside, or on the circle:

    $$\begin{eqnarray*}
    (2,-3): \sqrt{2^2 + (-3)^2} = \sqrt{13} \approx 3.6 & & \textrm{\{inside circle\}}\\
    (1,5): \sqrt{1^2 + 5^2} = \sqrt{26} \approx 5.1 & & \textrm{\{outside circle\}}\\
    (-4,-3): \sqrt{(-4)^2 + (-3)^2} = \sqrt{25} = 5 & & \textrm{\{on circle\}}\\
    \end{eqnarray*}$$

  </p>

  <h3>Line and circle intersection</h3>
  <p>
    Assuming a circle \(x^2 + y^2 = r^2\) and a line \(y = ax + b\),
    both on their standard form (if not, we first must bring those on
    standard form), three possible intersection scenarios exists:
  </p>
  <p>
    <img src="/content/circle-line-intersection-options.gif"/>
  </p>
  <p>
    As an example, let's go with the circle \(x^2 + y^2 = 3^2\) and
    the line \(y = -x + 3\). If the two intersect, it implies that for
    some same value of \(x\) and for some same value of \(y\),
    plugging those values into both equations, they each hold true. It
    doesn't imply that the left side of one equation equals the right
    side of the other, but that the left and right side of each
    equation by itself holds true.
  </p>
  <p>
    At a point of intersection, the value of \(x\) and the value of
    \(y\) in the two equation are the same. Thus, either \(y = -x +
    3\) or \(x = -y + 3\) of the line equation may be plugged into the
    circle equation. Plugging in \(y\) results in

    $$x^2 + (-x + 3)^2 = 3^2$$

    The goal of plugging one equation into the other is that instead
    of one circle equation with two variables (\(x\) and \(y\)), out
    comes one quadratic equation with one variable (\(x\)):

    $$\begin{eqnarray*}
    x^2 + (-x + 3)(-x + 3) = 3^2 & & \textrm{\{expand \(y = -x + 3\)\}}\\
    x^2 + x^2 - 3x - 3x + 9 = 9 & & \textrm{\{multiply out parenthesis\}}\\
    x^2 + x^2 - 3x - 3x = 0 & & \textrm{\{subtract 9 from both sides\}}\\
    2x^2 - 6x = 0 & & \textrm{\{simplify\}}
    \end{eqnarray*}$$

    Solving a quadratic equation of the standard form \(ax^2 + bx + c
    = 0\) for \(x\) means determining values of \(x\) for which \(y =
    0\). In other words, determining where the quadratic equation
    intersects the \(x\) axis.
  </p>
  <p>
    Depicted graphically, the line, circle, and quadratic equations
    are shown below. Visually, it's easy to confirm that the solutions
    to the quadratic equation are \(x_1 = 0\) and \(x_2 = 3\):
  </p>
  <p>
    <img src="/content/circle-line-intersection-example.gif" width="550px"/>
  </p>
  <p>
    Solving algebraically, the standard method involves plugging the
    coefficients of \(ax^2 + bx + c\), that is \(a\), \(b\), and
    \(c\), into the equation below, with \(d\) being the discriminant:

    $$\begin{eqnarray*}
    x = \dfrac{-b \pm \sqrt{d}}{2a} \textrm{, where \(d = b^2 - 4ac\)}
    \end{eqnarray*}$$

    The discriminant signals which of the three intersection scenarios
    to expect. If \(d = 0\), then one solution, or intersection, exist
    as the square root term disappears from the equation. If \(d >
    0\), two solutions, or intersections, exist as the square root
    term must be both added and subtracted. If \(d < 0\), no solution,
    or intersection, exist as calculating the square root of a
    negative number is undefined:
  </p>				  
  <p>
    $$d = (-6)^2 - 4(2)(0) = 36$$

    Calculating the discriminant on its own, without plugging it into
    the larger equation, is useful only as a means to determine the
    number of solutions. For the actual solutions, the points of
    intersection, the larger equation is needed:

    $$\begin{eqnarray*}    
    x_1 = \dfrac{-(-6) + \sqrt{36}}{2(2)} = \dfrac{6 + 6}{4} = \dfrac{12}{4} = 3\\
    x_2 = \dfrac{-(-6) - \sqrt{36}}{2(2)} = \dfrac{6 - 6}{4} = \dfrac{0}{4} = 0
    \end{eqnarray*}$$

    Finally, plugging the two values of \(x\) into either equation
    gets us the corresponding values of \(y\). The line equation is
    the simplest of the two:

    $$\begin{eqnarray*}
    y_1 = -x_1 + 3 = -0 + 3 = 3\\
    y_2 = -x_2 + 3 = -3 + 3 = 0
    \end{eqnarray*}$$

    and so the points of intersection of the line and the circle are
    at \((0,3)\) and \((3,0)\).

  <h3>Summary</h3>
  <p>
    At first sight, the math introduced in this post may not seem all
    that relevant or important. After all, most high school students
    are taught these subjects. The true power, however, become
    apparent in
    the <a href="/blog/2018/09/03/ray-tracing-computing-ray-sphere-intersections">next</a>
    post where the techniques are generalized from 2D to 3D (to any
    dimension, actually) and from scalars to vectors. 3D and vectors
    are what's needed for ray tracing.
