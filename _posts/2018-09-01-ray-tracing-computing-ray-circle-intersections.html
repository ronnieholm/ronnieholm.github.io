    I'm currently making my way
    through <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ray-Tracing-Weekend-Minibooks-Book-ebook/dp/B01B5AODD8">Ray
    tracing in One Weekend</a>, now available for
    <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/14yayBb9XiL16lmuhbYhhvea8mKUUK77W">free</a>,
    and its 500 lines
    of <a href="https://github.com/petershirley/raytracinginoneweekend">C++
    code</a>. Being a bit rusty on the math side, these posts are my
    notes and supplement the book.
  </p>  
  <p>
    In Part 1, we focus on computing 2D line-circle intersection by
    hand and
    in <a href="/blog/2018/09/03/ray-tracing-computing-ray-sphere-intersections">Part
    2</a> we extend the approach to 3D. Computing possible positions
    of intersection is useful when tracing a ray from the eye, or
    camera position, through a pixel on the screen, or image plane,
    and into the scene. As the ray travels through the scene, we want
    to know if it hits, or intersects with, the circle, or scene
    object, and if so at which positions. Whether the ray intersects
    with a scene object and where determines the image plane's color
    at that pixel.
  </p>
  <p>
    We start out with line-circle intersections in 2D because it's
    simpler to visualize and because once its scalar math is worked
    out, it generalizes nicely to 3D and vector math.
  </p>
  <p>
    The concept of intersection in 3D space, and what we're working
    toward, is nicely illustrated in the Wikipedia article
    on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_tracing_(graphics)">ray
    tracing</a>:

  <h3>Circle centered around origin</h3>
  <p>
    A circle may be defined in terms of the position of its center and
    its radius. To start simple, assume the circle is centered around
    the origin at \((0,0)\). The circle equation, or circle on
    standard form as it's also called, then becomes

    $$x^2 + y^2 = r^2$$

    The way to read the circle equation is that for any point
    \((x,y)\), if \(x^2 + y^2 = r^2\), then the point is on the
    circle, otherwise it's not. The circle equation follows from the
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagorean_theorem">Pythagorean
    theorem</a>, or distance formula. To visualize the relationship
    between the circle equation and the Pythagorean theorem, consider
    a point \((x,y)\) on the circle shown below:
  </p>
  <p>
    <img src="/content/circle-equation.gif" width="350px"/>
  </p>
  <p>
    For this right-sided triangle and point on circle, \(\sqrt{x^2 +
    y^2} = r\). By squaring both sides we get rid of the square root
    and end up with the circle equation.
  </p>

  <h3>Circle offset from origin</h3>
  <p>
    Instead of a circle centered at \((0,0)\), it may be centered at
    any point \((c_x, c_y)\), extending the circle equation:
    
    $$\begin{eqnarray*}
    (x - c_x)^2 + (y - c_y)^2 = r^2 & & \textrm{or} & & \sqrt{(x - c_x)^2 + (y - c_y)^2} = r
    \end{eqnarray*}$$
    
    For instance, imagine the circle's center being to the right and
    up with respect to origin. For the circle equation to still hold
    true, \((x,y)\) points on the circle must have greater values of
    \(x\) and \(y\) than when the circle was centered at origin.
  </p>
  <p>
    To keep the following examples short, we assume the circle is
    centered at \((0,0)\) such that \(c_x\) and \(c_y\) may be
    ignored.
  </p>

  <h3>Circle from point on circle</h3>
  <p>
    Circle equation in hand, if provided with a point \((x,y) =
    (-3,4)\) known to be on the circle, and assuming the circle is
    centered around origin, its circle equation can be determined:

    $$\begin{eqnarray*}
    x^2 + y^2 = r^2\\
    (-3)^2 + 4^2 = r^2\\
    9 + 16 = r^2\\
    5 = r
    \end{eqnarray*}$$

    meaning the circle's equation is
    
    $$x^2 + y^2 = 5^2$$
  </p>

  <h3>Points inside, on, or outside circle</h3>
  <p>
    The distance of a point to the center of a circle is defined by
    \(x^2 + y^2 = 5^2\). Thus any point may be determined as either
    inside, outside, or on the circle:

    $$\begin{eqnarray*}
    (2,-3): \sqrt{2^2 + (-3)^2} = \sqrt{13} \approx 3.6 & & \textrm{\{inside circle\}}\\
    (-4,-3): \sqrt{(-4)^2 + (-3)^2} = \sqrt{25} = 5 & & \textrm{\{on circle\}}\\
    (1,5): \sqrt{1^2 + 5^2} = \sqrt{26} \approx 5.1 & & \textrm{\{outside circle\}}
    \end{eqnarray*}$$
  </p>

  <h3>Line and circle intersections</h3>
  <p>
    Assuming a circle \(x^2 + y^2 = r^2\) and a line \(y = ax + b\),
    both on standard form (if not, we first must bring those on
    standard form), three possible intersection scenarios exists:
  </p>
  <p>
    <img src="/content/circle-line-intersection-options.gif"/>
  </p>
  <p>
    As an example, let's go with the circle \(x^2 + y^2 = 3^2\) and
    the line \(y = -x + 3\). If the two intersect, it implies that for
    some value of \(x\) and for some value of \(y\), plugging those
    <i>same</i> values into both equations, each equation holds. It
    doesn't imply that the left side of one equation equals the right
    side of the other, but that the left and right side of each
    equation by itself is equal.
  </p>
  <p>
    At a point of intersection, the value of \(x\) and the value of
    \(y\) in the two equations are the same. Thus, either \(y = -x +
    3\) or \(x = -y + 3\) of the line equation may be plugged into the
    circle equation. Plugging in \(y\) yields a new equation:

    $$x^2 + (-x + 3)^2 = 3^2$$

    The goal of plugging one equation into the other is that instead
    of one circle equation with two variables (\(x\) and \(y\)), out
    comes one quadratic equation with one variable (\(x\)):

    $$\begin{eqnarray*}
    x^2 + (-x + 3)(-x + 3) = 3^2 & & \textrm{\{expand \(y = -x + 3\)\}}\\
    x^2 + x^2 - 3x - 3x + 9 = 9 & & \textrm{\{multiply out parenthesis\}}\\
    x^2 + x^2 - 3x - 3x = 0 & & \textrm{\{subtract 9 from both sides\}}\\
    2x^2 - 6x = 0 & & \textrm{\{simplify\}}
    \end{eqnarray*}$$

    Solving a quadratic equation of the standard form \(ax^2 + bx + c
    = 0\) for \(x\) means determining values of \(x\) for which \(y =
    0\). In other words, determining where the quadratic equation
    intersects the \(x\) axis.
  </p>
  <p>
    The line, circle, and quadratic equations are depicted graphically
    below. From the graphs, it's easy to visually confirm that the
    solutions to the quadratic equation are \(x_1 = 0\) and \(x_2 =
    3\):
  </p>
  <p>
    <img src="/content/circle-line-intersection-example.gif" width="550px"/>
  </p>
  <p>
    The standard method for solving algebraically involves plugging
    the coefficients of \(ax^2 + bx + c\), that is \(a\), \(b\), and
    \(c\), into the equation below, with \(d\) being the discriminant:

    $$\begin{eqnarray*}
    x = \dfrac{-b \pm \sqrt{d}}{2a} \textrm{, where \(d = b^2 - 4ac\)}
    \end{eqnarray*}$$

    The discriminant indicates which of the three intersection
    scenarios to expect. If \(d = 0\), then one solution, or
    intersection, exist as the square root term disappears. If \(d >
    0\), two solutions, or intersections, exist as the square root
    term must be both added and subtracted. If \(d < 0\), no solution,
    or intersection, exists as calculating the square root of a
    negative number is undefined:
  </p>				  
  <p>
    $$d = (-6)^2 - 4(2)(0) = 36$$

    Computing the discriminant without plugging it into the larger
    equation is useful only as a means to determine the number of
    solutions in advance. For the actual solutions, the points of
    intersection, the larger equation is required:

    $$\begin{eqnarray*}    
    x_1 = \dfrac{-(-6) + \sqrt{36}}{2(2)} = \dfrac{6 + 6}{4} = \dfrac{12}{4} = 3\\
    x_2 = \dfrac{-(-6) - \sqrt{36}}{2(2)} = \dfrac{6 - 6}{4} = \dfrac{0}{4} = 0
    \end{eqnarray*}$$

    Finally, inserting the values of \(x\) into either equation gets
    us the corresponding values of \(y\). The line equation is the
    simplest of the two:

    $$\begin{eqnarray*}
    y_1 = -x_1 + 3 = -0 + 3 = 3\\
    y_2 = -x_2 + 3 = -3 + 3 = 0
    \end{eqnarray*}$$

    and so the points of intersection of the line and the circle are
    at \((0,3)\) and \((3,0)\).

  <h3>Summary</h3>
  <p>
    At first sight, the math in this post may seem like unimportant
    high school math. Its true power, however, becomes
    evident <a href="/blog/2018/09/03/ray-tracing-computing-ray-sphere-intersections">next</a>,
    when the techniques are generalized from lines and circles in 2D
    to lines and spheres in 3D and from scalars to vectors.
