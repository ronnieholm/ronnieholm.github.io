<div id="post">

<p>This post outlines the steps involved from generating a memory dump
of a process, running some version of the .NET CLR on one machine, to
loading the dump into WinDbg running on another machine. Inside
WinDbg, we want the SOS debugger extension loaded to interrogate the
dump. Specifically, SOS should load even if the WinDbg machine and the
machine running the dumped process doesn't have the same version of
the .NET CLR installed.</p>

<h4>Step 1: Generate process dump</h4>

<p>To generate an exemplar dump, navigate to Task manager, right click
on w3wp.exe which I know to be running .NET code, and select Create
dump file. More advanced options for generating dumps are available as
well. For
instance, <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/ff537953">ADPlus</a>,
<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=49924">DebugDiag</a>,
and
<a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/dd996900.aspx">ProcDump</a>
can all create dumps based on triggers like CPU or memory utilization
exceeding a threshold over a period of time, or when a certain type of
exception is thrown.</p>

<p>In order to load the dump into WinDbg in the next steps, we must
determine the CLR version running inside the w3wp process and its
bitness. If in doubt about the CLR version, we can always check IIS
application pool settings. As for the bitness, Task Manager shows
w3wp.exe without an *32 suffix, indicating it's a 64 bit process. In
summary, the w3wp process dumped runs SharePoint 2007 on .NET version
2.0.50727, 64 bit.</p>

<p>Looking inside C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework64, each x64
version of .NET appear as a subdirectory (v2.0.50727, v4.0.30319, and
so on). What's missing from the folder name is the patch
version. Inspecting the properties of one of the DLLs in the
v2.0.50727 folder, its version number including patch version is
2.0.50727.4253.</p>

<h4>Step 2: Copy dump and .NET CLR DLLs to other machine</h4>

<p>To load and inspect the dump, part of the .NET CLR of the machine
running w3wp must be available on the machine running WinDbg. Because
the WinDbg machine may have .NET v2.0.50727 installed, but with a
different patch version, we must copy two files from the .NET
Framework folder, in addition to the dump file itself, to the WinDbg
machine:</p>

<ul>
<li>mscordacwks.dll: the Microsoft Common Object
Runtime <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/blob/master/Documentation/botr/dac-notes.md">Data
Access Component</a> for workstations (COR was one of the early names
for .NET) exposes an API through which WinDbg can access the memory,
and hence the CLR data structures, of w3wp at the time of the
dump. The component is actually created from the same source as the
CLR executing in-process, and during postmortem debugging acts as a
stand-in for the actual CLR which is frozen in time. The stand-in is
necessarily as WinDbg requires some CLR query capabilities to traverse
dump file data structures.</li>

<li>sos.dll: short
for <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3572990/whats-the-story-behind-the-name-of-the-sos-son-of-strike-debugger-extension">Son
of Strike</a>, this library contains WinDbg .NET extension
commands. By utilizing mscordacwks.dll and natively inspecting the
dump, these SOS commands query CLR internals and expose those in a
digestible format. Without mscordacwks.dll and sos.dll, we'd be
looking at CLR structures as layed out in memory.</li>
</ul> 

<p>Because the CLR, and therefore the implementation of the SOS
commands, change with each version of .NET, specific versions of these
files ships with every .NET version.</p>

<p>Now copy w3wp.dmp, mscordacwks.dll, and sos.dll to the
C:\debug\w3wp-sp2007 folder on the WinDbg machine.</p>

<h4>Step 3: First attempt at loading w3wp.dmp into WinDbg</h4>

<p>Open WinDbg (X64) and navigate to the File menu, Open Crash
Dump... and locate C:\debug\w3wp-sp2007\w3wp.dmp. In response, WinDbg
prints the following output:</p>

<p>If both debugger and debuggee were running on the same machine,
we'd start by issuing the following commands to set the symbol path to
the public Microsoft symbol server and reload symbols for modules into
the debuggee's process. Next we'd be able to load SOS extensions based
on the version of mscorwks loaded by the debuggee (on more recent
versions of the CLR, it's <code>.loadby sos clr</code>):</p>

</pre>

<p>Recent versions of WinDbg appear to do <code>.symfix</code> on
startup, rendering <code>.symfix</code> and <code>.reload</code>
redundant.</p>

<h4>Step 4: Second attempt at loading w3wp.dmp into WinDbg</h4>

<p>Even though we aren't presented with an error message, issuing the
<code>!CLRStack</code> command from SOS (and other SOS commands),
yields the following error message:</p>

<pre>
0:000> <strong style="color: green;">!CLRStack</strong>
Failed to load data access DLL, 0x80004005
Verify that 1) you have a recent build of the debugger (6.2.14 or newer)
            2) the file mscordacwks.dll that matches your version of mscorwks.dll is 
                in the version directory
            3) or, if you are debugging a dump file, verify that the file 
                mscordacwks_&lt;arch&gt;_&lt;arch&gt;_&lt;version&gt;.dll is on your symbol path.
            4) you are debugging on the same architecture as the dump file.
                For example, an IA64 dump file must be debugged on an IA64
                machine.

You can also run the debugger command .cordll to control the
debugger's load of mscordacwks.dll. .cordll -ve -u -l will do a
verbose reload.  If that succeeds, the SOS command should work on
retry.

If you are debugging a minidump, you need to make sure that your executable
path is pointing to mscorwks.dll as well.
</pre>

<p>(As a sidenote, notice the above HRESULT: 0x80004005. WinDbg has a
command for converting this error number into text: <code>!error
80004005</code> yields <code>Error code: (HRESULT) 0x80004005
(2147500037) - Unspecified error.</code>)</p>

<p>Let's address the suggested verification steps one by one:</p>

<ol>
<li>Not an issue as we're running WinDbg 10.0.14321.1024.</li>
<li>WinDbg looked in C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework64\v2.0.50727,
but didn't find a version of mscordacwks.dll matching the CLR version
inside the dump. Remember how the w3wp process executed under
v2.0.50727.4253, but inside the folder on the WinDbg machine, its
version is v2.0.50727.8009.</li>
<li>Tells how to fix our version mismatch issue by renaming
C:\Debug\w3wp-sp2007\mscordacwks.dll to
mscordacwks_AMD64_AMD64_2.0.50727.4253.dll and including
C:\Debug\w3wp-sp2007 in the symbol path (which we'll do in a
moment).</li>
<li>Not an issue because both the debugger and debuggee machines are
AMD64 processor architecture-based. If uncertain about the
architecture, have a look at the PROCESSOR_ARCHITECTURE environment
variable, which on both machine have a value of AMD64.</li>
</ol>

<p>The <code>.sympath</code> command can be used to both show the
current symbol paths and append to those by issueing the following
command:</p>

<pre>
0:000> <strong style="color: green;">.sympath+ C:\Debug\w3wp-sp2007</strong>
Symbol search path is: srv*;C:\Debug\w3wp-sp2007
Expanded Symbol search path is: cache*;SRV*https://msdl.microsoft.com/download/symbols;c:\debug\w3wp-sp2007

************* Symbol Path validation summary **************

OK                                             C:\Debug\w3wp-sp2007
</pre>

<p>Next, run
the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/ff562263"><code>.cordll</code></a>
command as indicated below the verification suggestions above.</p>

<pre>
0:000> <strong style="color: green;">.cordll -ve -u -l</strong>
CLRDLL: C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework64\v2.0.50727\mscordacwks.dll:2.0.50727.8009 f:0
doesn't match desired version 2.0.50727.4253 f:0
CLRDLL: Unable to find '' on the path
Cannot Automatically load SOS
CLRDLL: Loaded DLL c:\debug\w3wp-sp2007\mscordacwks_AMD64_AMD64_2.0.50727.4253.dll
CLR DLL status: Loaded DLL c:\debug\w3wp-sp2007\mscordacwks_AMD64_AMD64_2.0.50727.4253.dll
</pre>

<p>From the output, it's clear that now the correct version of
mscordacwks.dll is loaded. However, SOS wasn't.</p>

<p>What <code>.cordll</code> does is search a number of locations,
including the public Microsoft symbol server for the two DLLs (we can
make WinDbg print the paths searched by <code>!sym
noisy</code>/<code>!sym quiet</code>). For this version of the CLR,
the DLLs aren't on the symbol server, and we see a lot of failed
attempts at locating mscordacwks_AMD64_AMD64_2.0.50727.4253.dll before
it's found and WinDbg shifts to looking for
SOS_AMD64_AMD64_2.0.50727.4253.dll but is unsuccessful. While WinDbg
doesn't probe C:\Debug\w3wp-sp2007, the output hints that we should
rename sos.dll to sos_AMD64_AMD64_2.0.50727.4253.dll and rerun
<code>.cordll</code>.</p>

<pre>
0:000> <strong style="color: green;">.cordll -ve -u -l</strong>
CLRDLL: C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework64\v2.0.50727\mscordacwks.dll:2.0.50727.8009 f:0

CLRDLL: Loaded DLL c:\debug\w3wp-sp2007\mscordacwks_AMD64_AMD64_2.0.50727.4253.dll

</pre>

<h4>Conclusion</h4>

<p>At this point we've successfully loaded the correct version of both
DLLs and the SOS commands are at our disposal.</p>
