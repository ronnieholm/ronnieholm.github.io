<div id="post">

<p>This post outlines the steps involved from generating a memory dump
of a process, running some version of the CLR on one machine, to
loading the dump into WinDbg running on another machine. Inside
WinDbg, we want
the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb190764">SOS
debugger extension</a> loaded to interrogate the dump. Specifically,
SOS should load even if the WinDbg machine doesn't have the version of
the CLR installed that the machine running the dumped process has.</p>

<h4>Step 1: Generate process dump</h4>

<p>To generate an exemplar dump, navigate to Windows Task Manager,
right click on w3wp.exe which we know is running .NET code, and select
Create dump file. For the cases where we want to generate dumps based
on triggers like CPU or memory utilization exceeding some threshold,
or when a process throws a certain type of
exception, <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/ff537953">ADPlus</a>,
<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=49924">DebugDiag</a>,
and
<a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/dd996900.aspx">ProcDump</a>
provide better methods for dump capture.</p>

<p>In preparation for copying the dump to the WinDbg machine, we must
determine the CLR version running inside the w3wp process and its
bitness. If in doubt about the CLR version, we can always check IIS
application pool settings, which in this case shows .NET Framework
v2.0.50727. As for the bitness, Task Manager shows w3wp without the
*32 suffix, indicating a 64 bit process. As an alternative, we
could've used
Sysinternals <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/processexplorer.aspx">Process
Explorer</a> and looked for DLLs loaded into the process coming from
one of the C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET subfolders.</p>

<p>Inside C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework64, each x64 version of
.NET appears as a subfolder (v2.0.50727, v4.0.30319, and so
on). What's missing from the folder name versioning scheme is the
patch version. Looking at the properties of one of the DLLs inside the
v2.0.50727 folder, we see the exact version of the CLR running inside
the w3wp process is actually 2.0.50727.4253.</p>

<p>Armed with the memory dump and knowledge about version and bitness
of the CLR running managed code inside the dumped process, we're ready
to copy the dump and auxiliary files to the WinDbg machine.</p>

<h4>Step 2: Copy dump and .NET CLR DLLs to other machine</h4>

<p>For WinDbg to be able to load and inspect the dump, auxiliary files
from the CLR running inside w3wp must be available it. These files,
matching patch version and bitness as determined above, may already
exist on the WinDbg machine. But rather than assuming it, we copy the
required two files from the .NET Framework folder of the w3wp machine,
in addition to the dump file, to the WinDbg machine:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><b>mscordacwks.dll</b>: the Microsoft Common Object
Runtime <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/blob/master/Documentation/botr/dac-notes.md">Data
Access Component</a> for workstations (COR was an early name for the
CLR) exposes APIs through which WinDbg can access memory, and thereby
CLR data structures, of the dumpted process. The component is actually
compiled from the same source code as the CLR executing
in-process. During postmortem debugging it acts as a stand-in for the
CLR, frozen in time inside the dump. Inside a running process,
querying CLR data structures implies not only reading memory
structures, but also executing native code to interpret those
structures. Running outside the debugged process, the data access
component serves this same purpose.</p></li>

<li><p><b>sos.dll</b>: short
for <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3572990/whats-the-story-behind-the-name-of-the-sos-son-of-strike-debugger-extension">Son
of Strike</a>, this library contains WinDbg .NET extension
commands. By utilizing mscordacwks.dll (and by natively inspecting the
dump), these SOS commands query and interpret CLR data structures and
surface those in a digestible format. Without mscordacwks.dll and
sos.dll, we'd be looking at CLR data structures as they're layed out
in memory.</p></li>
</ul> 

<p>Because CLR internals, and by implication the SOS commands, are
subject to change with new runtime versions, specific versions of
mscordacwks.dll and sos.dll ship with each runtime. Thus, collect
mscordacwks.dll and sos.dll from the .NET framework folder and
together with w3wp.dmp copy these files to the C:\debug\w3wp-sp2007
folder on the WinDbg machine.</p>

<h4>Step 3: First attempt at loading w3wp.dmp into WinDbg</h4>

<p>Open WinDbg (X64) and go to the File menu, Open Crash Dump... and
locate C:\debug\w3wp-sp2007\w3wp.dmp. In response, WinDbg prints the
following output:</p>

</pre>

<p>Next we issue commands to set the symbol path to the public
Microsoft symbol server and reload symbols for modules loaded into
w3wp. Then, based on the folder location (the version) of mscorwks.dll
loaded into w3wp, we load SOS from the same
path. The <code>.loadby</code> command is actually a shortcut for the
general <code>.load</code> command, accepting a path of a DLL to
load. <code>.loadby</code> got introduced because .NET DLLs tend to
have a lengthy path, and so the shortcut resolves the path based on
the location of the loaded mscorwks.dll. On CLR 4.0 and above, the
command is <code>.loadby sos clr</code> because the CLR is now inside
clr.dll:</p>

</pre>

<p>As an aside, recent versions of WinDbg run <code>.symfix</code> on
startup, rendering the <code>.symfix</code> and <code>.reload</code>
commands from above redundant.</p>

<p>Judging from the absence of any error message, it seems that SOS
got loaded. But that isn't the case as we'll see in a moment.</p>

<p></p>

<h4>Step 4: Second attempt at loading w3wp.dmp into WinDbg</h4>

<p>Even though we see no error messages, issuing the
<code>!CLRStack</code> command, which is part of SOS (and other SOS
commands for that matter), yields the following error message:</p>

<pre>
0:000> <strong style="color: green;">!CLRStack</strong>
Failed to load data access DLL, 0x80004005
Verify that 1) you have a recent build of the debugger (6.2.14 or newer)
            2) the file mscordacwks.dll that matches your version of mscorwks.dll is 
                in the version directory
            3) or, if you are debugging a dump file, verify that the file 
                mscordacwks_&lt;arch&gt;_&lt;arch&gt;_&lt;version&gt;.dll is on your symbol path.
            4) you are debugging on the same architecture as the dump file.
                For example, an IA64 dump file must be debugged on an IA64
                machine.

You can also run the debugger command .cordll to control the
debugger's load of mscordacwks.dll. .cordll -ve -u -l will do a
verbose reload.  If that succeeds, the SOS command should work on
retry.

If you are debugging a minidump, you need to make sure that your executable
path is pointing to mscorwks.dll as well.
</pre>

<p>As an aside, notice the HRESULT: 0x80004005 above. WinDbg comes
with a command for converting an HRESULT error number into
text: <code>!error 80004005</code> resolves to <code>Error code:
(HRESULT) 0x80004005 (2147500037) - Unspecified error</code>.</p>

<p>Let's address the suggested verification steps one by one:</p>

<ol>
<li>Isn't relevant as we're running WinDbg 10.0.14321.1024.</li>
<li>WinDbg looked in C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework64\v2.0.50727,
but didn't find a version of mscordacwks.dll matching the CLR version
inside the dump. Remember that the w3wp process was executing under
v2.0.50727.4253, but the CLR version inside the v2.0.50727 folder on
the WinDbg machine turns out to be v2.0.50727.8009.</li>
<li>Tells how to fix the CLR version mismatch issue by renaming
C:\Debug\w3wp-sp2007\mscordacwks.dll to
mscordacwks_AMD64_AMD64_2.0.50727.4253.dll and adding
C:\Debug\w3wp-sp2007 to the symbol path.</li>
<li>Isn't an issue because the architecture of the machines running
WinDbg and wp3wp are both AMD64. If unsure about the architecture,
have a look at the PROCESSOR_ARCHITECTURE environment variable, which
on both machines have the value of AMD64.</li>
</ol>

<p>As per suggestion (3), the <code>.sympath</code> command can both
show the current symbol paths and append a path to it:</p>

<pre>
0:000> <strong style="color: green;">.sympath+ C:\Debug\w3wp-sp2007</strong>
Symbol search path is: srv*;C:\Debug\w3wp-sp2007
Expanded Symbol search path is: cache*;SRV*https://msdl.microsoft.com/download/symbols;c:\debug\w3wp-sp2007

************* Symbol Path validation summary **************

OK                                             C:\Debug\w3wp-sp2007
</pre>

<p>Now run
<a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/ff562263"><code>.cordll
-ve -u -l</code></a> as suggested below the verification steps.</p>

<pre>
0:000> <strong style="color: green;">.cordll -ve -u -l</strong>
CLRDLL: C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework64\v2.0.50727\mscordacwks.dll:2.0.50727.8009 f:0
doesn't match desired version 2.0.50727.4253 f:0
CLRDLL: Unable to find '' on the path
Cannot Automatically load SOS
CLRDLL: Loaded DLL c:\debug\w3wp-sp2007\mscordacwks_AMD64_AMD64_2.0.50727.4253.dll
CLR DLL status: Loaded DLL c:\debug\w3wp-sp2007\mscordacwks_AMD64_AMD64_2.0.50727.4253.dll
</pre>

<p>From the output it seems that the correct version of
mscordacwks.dll got loaded, but sos.dll didn't.</p>

<p>What <code>.cordll</code> does is search locations, including the
public Microsoft symbol server, for the DLLs (WinDbg prints/hides the
paths searched through the <code>!sym noisy</code>/<code>!sym
quiet</code> commands). Activating noisy output, we can tell that for
this version of the CLR the DLLs aren't on the symbol server, and we
see failed attempts at locating
mscordacwks_AMD64_AMD64_2.0.50727.4253.dll before it's finally
located. Then WinDbg starts looking for
sos_AMD64_AMD64_2.0.50727.4253.dll but cannot locate it. The output
indicates that we should rename sos.dll to
sos_AMD64_AMD64_2.0.50727.4253.dll and rerun
<code>.cordll -ve -u -l</code>.</p>

<pre>
0:000> <strong style="color: green;">.cordll -ve -u -l</strong>
CLRDLL: C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework64\v2.0.50727\mscordacwks.dll:2.0.50727.8009 f:0

</pre>
