<div id="post">

<p>This post outlines the steps involved from generating a memory dump
of a process, running some version of the .NET CLR on one machine, to
loading the dump into WinDbg running on another machine. Inside
WinDbg, we want the SOS debugger extension loaded to interrogate the
dump. Specifically, SOS should load even when the WinDbg machine and
the machine running the dumped process doesn't have the same version
of the .NET CLR installed.</p>

<h4>Step 1: Generate process dump</h4>

<p>To generate an exemplar dump, navigate to Task manager, right click
on w3wp.exe, which I know to be running .NET code, and select Create
dump file. More advanced options for generating dumps are available as
well. For
instance, <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/ff537953">ADPlus</a>,
<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=49924">DebugDiag</a>,
and
<a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/dd996900.aspx">ProcDump</a>
can create dumps based on triggers like CPU or memory utilization
exceeding a threshold over a period of time, or when a certain type of
exception is thrown.</p>

<p>In order to load in the dumps in the next steps, we must determine
the CLR version running inside the w3wp process and the process'
bitness. If in doubt about the .NET version, we can always check the
IIS application pool configuration. As for the bitness, Task Manager
shows w3wp.exe without the *32 postfix, indicating it's a 64 bit
process. The w3wp process dumped runs SharePoint 2007 on .NET version
2.0.50727, 64 bit.</p>

<p>Looking inside C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework64, each x64
version of .NET appear as a subdirectory (v2.0.50727, v4.0.30319, and
so on). What's missing from the folder name is the patch version. By
inspecting the properties of one of the DLLs in the v2.0.50727 folder
for instance, we see that version number including patch level is
2.0.50727.4253.</p>

<h4>Step 2: Collect dump with matching .NET CLR DLLs</h4>

<p>The .NET CLR version, including patch level, must be available on
the WinDbg machine to load and inspect the dump. That WinDbg machine
may have .NET v2.0.50727 installed, but with a different patch
level. To remedy this issue, we must extract two files from the .NET
Framework folder:</p>

<ul>
<li>mscordacwks.dll: the Microsoft Common Object
Runtime <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/blob/master/Documentation/botr/dac-notes.md">Data
Access Component</a> for workstations exposes an API through which
WinDbg has access to internal CLR data structures (COR was one of the
early names for .NET). The component is actually created from the same
source as the CLR executing in-process (mscoree.dll, MS COR Execution
Engine). In a postmortem dump, the CLR of the debuggee isn't running,
yet we require access to some of its runtime capabilities to traverse
its data structures. During postmortem debugging mscordacwks.dll acts
as stand-in for the actual CLR.</li>

<li>sos.dll: short
for <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3572990/whats-the-story-behind-the-name-of-the-sos-son-of-strike-debugger-extension">Sun
of Strike</a>, this library contains WinDbg extension commands. By
utilizing mscordacwks.dll and natively inspecting the dump, these SOS
commands query CLR internals and expose internals in a digestible
format. Without mscordacwks.dll and sos.dll, we'd be looking at CLR
structures as they're layed out in memory.</li>
</ul> 

<p>Because the CLR internals and SOS commands implementation likely
change with each version of .NET, specific versions of these files
ships with every .NET version.</p>

<p>Now we can gather up w3wp.dmp, mscordacwks.dll, and sos.dll and
copy those to the C:\debug\w3wp-sp2007 folder on the WinDbg
machine.</p>

<h4>Step 3: First attempt at loading w3wp.dmp into WinDbg</h4>

<p>Open WinDbg (X64) and navigate to the File menu, Open Crash
Dump... and locate C:\debug\w3wp-sp2007\w3wp.dmp. In response, WinDbg
prints the following output:</p>

<pre>

</pre>

<p>If both debugger and debuggee were running on the same machine,
we'd start by issuing the following commands to set the symbol path to
the public Microsoft symbol server and reload symbols for modules in
the dump. Then we'd load SOS extensions based on the version of
mscorwks inside the dump (on more recent versions of the CLR,
it's <code>.loadby sos clr</code>):</p>

</pre>

<p>It appears that recent versions of WinDbg does <code>.symfix</code>
on startup, rendering <code>.symfix</code> and <code>.reload</code>
redundant.</p>

<h4>Step 4: First attempt at loading w3wp.dmp into WinDbg</h4>

<p>Even though we aren't presented with an error message, issuing the
<code>!CLRStack</code> command from SOS (and other SOS commands), will
yield the following error message:</p>

<pre>
0:000> <strong style="color: green;">!CLRStack</strong>
Failed to load data access DLL, 0x80004005
Verify that 1) you have a recent build of the debugger (6.2.14 or newer)
            2) the file mscordacwks.dll that matches your version of mscorwks.dll is 
                in the version directory
            3) or, if you are debugging a dump file, verify that the file 
                mscordacwks_&lt;arch&gt;_&lt;arch&gt;_&lt;version&gt;.dll is on your symbol path.
            4) you are debugging on the same architecture as the dump file.
                For example, an IA64 dump file must be debugged on an IA64
                machine.

You can also run the debugger command .cordll to control the
debugger's load of mscordacwks.dll. .cordll -ve -u -l will do a
verbose reload.  If that succeeds, the SOS command should work on
retry.

If you are debugging a minidump, you need to make sure that your executable
path is pointing to mscorwks.dll as well.
</pre>

<p>(As a sidenote, notice the above HRESULT: 0x80004005. WinDbg has a
command for converting this error number into text: <code>!error
80004005</code> yields <code>Error code: (HRESULT) 0x80004005
(2147500037) - Unspecified error.</code>)</p>

<p>Let's address the verification steps one by one:</p>

<ol>
<li>Not an issue as we're running WinDbg 10.0.14321.1024.</li>
<li>Means that WinDbg looked in the corresponding
C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework64\v2.0.50727 folder and didn't find
a version of mscordacwks.dll matching the CLR version inside the
dump. Remember that w3wp.exe executed under v2.0.50727.4253, but
looking inside the corresponding.NET folder on the WinDbg machine, the
version is v2.0.50727.8009.</li>
<li>Tells how to fix the issue by renaming
C:\Debug\w3wp-sp2007\mscordacwks.dll to
mscordacwks_AMD64_AMD64_2.0.50727.4253.dll and including
C:\Debug\w3wp-sp2007 in the symbol path (which we'll do in a
moment).</li>
<li>Not an issue because both the debugger and debuggee machines are
AMD64 processor architecture-based. If uncertain about the
architecture, have a look at the PROCESSOR_ARCHITECTURE environment
variable, which on both machine are set to AMD64.</li>
</ol>

<p>The <code>.sympath</code> command can be used to both show the
current symbol path as well as modify it. To append a symbol path to
the existing path, issue the following command:</p>

<pre>
0:000> <strong style="color: green;">.sympath+ C:\Debug\w3wp-sp2007</strong>
Symbol search path is: srv*;C:\Debug\w3wp-sp2007
Expanded Symbol search path is: cache*;SRV*https://msdl.microsoft.com/download/symbols;c:\debug\w3wp-sp2007

************* Symbol Path validation summary **************

OK                                             C:\Debug\w3wp-sp2007
</pre>

<p>Next, use
the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/ff562263"><code>.cordll</code></a>
command as indicated by WinDbg out below the verification steps
above.</p>

<pre>
0:000> <strong style="color: green;">.cordll -ve -u -l</strong>
CLRDLL: C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework64\v2.0.50727\mscordacwks.dll:2.0.50727.8009 f:0
doesn't match desired version 2.0.50727.4253 f:0
CLRDLL: Unable to find '' on the path
Cannot Automatically load SOS
CLRDLL: Loaded DLL c:\debug\w3wp-sp2007\mscordacwks_AMD64_AMD64_2.0.50727.4253.dll
CLR DLL status: Loaded DLL c:\debug\w3wp-sp2007\mscordacwks_AMD64_AMD64_2.0.50727.4253.dll
</pre>

<p>Running the above command, it's clear that now the correct version
of mscordacwks.dll is loaded. However, SOS wasn't loaded.</p>

<p>What .cordll does is search a number of locations, including the
public Microsoft symbol server for the two DLLs (we can make WinDbg
print the paths searched by by running <code>!sym
noisy</code>/<code>!sym quiet</code>). Unfortunately, for this old
version of the CLR the DLLs aren't present on the symbol
server. Therefore, lots of failed attempts at locating
mscordacwks_AMD64_AMD64_2.0.50727.4253.dll appears before it's found
and WinDbg shifts to looking for SOS_AMD64_AMD64_2.0.50727.4253.dll
but is unsuccessful. While we don't see a probe inside
C:\Debug\w3wp-sp2007, the output hints that we should change the name
of sos.dll to sos_AMD64_AMD64_2.0.50727.4253.dll and rerun
.cordll.</p>

<pre>
0:000> <strong style="color: green;">.cordll -ve -u -l</strong>
CLRDLL: C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework64\v2.0.50727\mscordacwks.dll:2.0.50727.8009 f:0

CLRDLL: Loaded DLL c:\debug\w3wp-sp2007\mscordacwks_AMD64_AMD64_2.0.50727.4253.dll

</pre>

<h4>Conclusion</h4>

<p>At this point we've successfully loaded both DLLs and SOS commands
are now available, even though the WinDbg machine doesn't have the
version of the CLR installed being debugged.</p>
