Part 2: ClrMD: Recreating .NET objects from an Azure App Service memory dump</a>
</p>
  
<p>In
the <a href="/blog/2017/08/06/windbg-recreating-dotnet-objects-from-an-azure-app-service-memory-dump">previous</a>
post, we concluded that while WinDbg is well-suited for interactive
exploration of an object graph, scripting would involve parsing text
output. As a way around text parsing, in this post we explore
the <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/clrmd">Microsoft Diagnostics
Runtime</a>, or ClrMD, a framework for inspecting .NET memory dumps
from a .NET application. With ClrMD our scripting language is
effectively C#.</p>

<h4>WinDbg vs ClrMD</h4>

<p>ClrMD supports the loading and querying of an opaque dump file in
much the same way that ADO.NET supports loading and querying an opaque
database file. Alternatively, think of ClrMD as the difference between
cmd and PowerShell. PowerShell returns objects over strings which
requires no parsing and is easy to continue processing. Instead of
text, ClrMD returns .NET meta-objects, representing a .NET application
frozen in time, and subject to querying using C#.</p>

<p>With ClrMD, locating instances of the
Bugfree.Spo.Analytics.Cli.Domain+Visit type on the heap is simple
enough. But extracting field values isn't. For starters, querying
requires knowledge on whether a field holds a value or reference type
and whether it's a primitive or complex type. Like with WinDbg, ClrMD
understands primitive types only. For Guid, DateTime, IPAddress, and
FSharpOption, we must query their internal field values and pass those
along to the appropriate constructor. With Guid, for instance, this
amounts to querying values of internal fields _a through _k and
passing those to the Guid constructor.</p>

<p>Another difficulty with ClrMD's API is that it often returns a null
value with little guidance as to why. And when it returns non-null,
it's all too easy
to <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22150259/how-to-properly-work-with-non-primitive-clrinstancefield-values-using-clrmd">read
the wrong memory location or misinterpret the result</a>, e.g.,
interpret random memory content as an object of some type, resulting
in an object initialized from random memory content.</p>

<h4>ClrMD.Extensions</h4>

<p><a href="https://github.com/JeffCyr/ClrMD.Extensions">ClrMD.Extensions</a>
is a library build on top of ClrMD to make querying more
intuitive. The extensions can even construct Guid, IPAddress, and
DateTime objects directly from heap object, and in very few lines of
code.</p>

<p>The only immediate downside to ClrMD.Extensions is that it doesn't
come as a NuGet package. One must clone its GitHub repository, built
the code, and reference the ClrMD.Extensions and
Microsoft.Diagnostics.Runtime DLLs from its bin/debug folder.</p>

<h4>Extracting and replaying visits</h4>

<p>The following code makes up a console application and is all it
takes
(code <a href="https://github.com/ronnieholm/Bugfree.Spo.Analytics/tree/master/src/Bugfree.Spo.Analytics.ProcessMemoryDump">available</a>
on Github) to query the dump, extract property values of Visit object,
create Visit objects from those values, and place those on the message
queue for replaying:</p>

                // Enumerating the heap doesn't preserve allocation order. Hence we impose an
                // order using the visit's timestamp for easier inspection.
                foreach (var v in visits.OrderBy(v =&gt; v.Timestamp)) {
                    visitor.Post(VisitorMessage.NewVisit(v));

                    Thread.Sleep(5000);

                    if (l == 0) {
                        break;
                    }
                }

                Console.ReadKey();
            }
        }
    }
}

<p>Whereas this code fulfills our need, it only scratches the surface
on what's possible with ClrMD and extensions. With access to mostly
the same data structures as
WinDbg's <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/tools/sos-dll-sos-debugging-extension">SOS
extensions</a>, we could implement most of its functionality in C#. In
fact, <a href="https://github.com/goldshtn/msos">msos</a> does exactly
this. Microsoft tools such
as <a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/debugdiag">DebugDiag</a>
and
<a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/perfview">PerfView</a> also use
ClrMD under the hood.</p>

<h4>Conclusion</h4>

<p>With the WinDbg textual output and object graph in mind, the
solution should be fairly easy to follow. Sharing configuration
settings between the console and the deployed web application, the
former behaves as the web application with respect to enqueuing and
dequeuing the 423k visits.</p>

<p>In a way, we've inadvertently turned the memory dump into a message
queue persistence mechanism.</p>
