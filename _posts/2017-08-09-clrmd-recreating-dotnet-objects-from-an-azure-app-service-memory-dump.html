Part 2: ClrMD: Recreating .NET objects from an Azure App Service memory dump</a>
</p>
  
<p>In
the <a href="/blog/2017/08/06/windbg-recreating-dotnet-objects-from-an-azure-app-service-memory-dump">previous</a>
post, we concluded that while WinDbg is well-suited for exploring and
querying an object graph, scripting involves parsing text output from
commands. As a way around text parsing, in this post we introduce
the <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/clrmd">Microsoft Diagnostics
Runtime</a>, or ClrMD, a framework for loading and inspecting .NET
memory dumps from within a .NET application.</p>

<h4>WinDbg vs ClrMD</h4>

<p>ClrMD supports the loading and querying of a dump file in much the
same way that ADO.NET supports loading and querying an opaque MS SQL
database file. Another way to think of ClrMD is like the difference
between cmd and PowerShell. PowerShell returns objects over strings
which comes in handy when processing the result. Instead of text,
ClrMD returns meta-objects, representing a .NET application frozen in
time, and subject to querying using standard programming
constructs.</p>

<p>Locating instances of the Bugfree.Spo.Analytics.Cli.Domain+Visit
type on the heap is simple enough with ClrMD. But extracting field
values from an object isn't. For starters, querying requires knowledge
about whether a field holds a value or reference type and whether the
field is a primitive or complex type. Like with WinDbg, ClrMD
understands only primitive types. With Guid, DateTime, IPAddress, and
FSharpOption, we must query internal field values and call the
appropriate constructor. For the Guid type, this amounts to querying
the values of instance fields _a through _k and passing those to the
Guid constructor.</p>

<p>Sometimes ClrMD's API return null values when they're unexpected
and it's all too easy
to <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22150259/how-to-properly-work-with-non-primitive-clrinstancefield-values-using-clrmd">read
the wrong memory location or misinterpret the result</a>, e.g.,
interpret random memory content as an object of some type, resulting
in an object initialized from random memory content.</p>

<h4>ClrMD.Extensions</h4>

<p><a href="https://github.com/JeffCyr/ClrMD.Extensions">ClrMD.Extensions</a>
builds on top of ClrMD and makes querying fields intuitive. The
extensions support directly constructing objects of type Guid,
IPAddress, and DateTime from heap objects. As another benefit, we
write much less code compared to ClrMD.</p>

<p>The only immediate downside to ClrMD.Extensions is that it doesn't
come as a NuGet package. One must clone the GitHub repository, built
the code, and reference the ClrMD.Extensions and
Microsoft.Diagnostics.Runtime DLLs from its bin/debug folder.</p>

<h4>Extracting and replaying visits</h4>

<p>The following code is part of a console application and all it
takes
(code <a href="https://github.com/ronnieholm/Bugfree.Spo.Analytics/tree/master/src/Bugfree.Spo.Analytics.ProcessMemoryDump">available</a>
on Github) to query the dump, extract visit values, create Visit
objects from these values, and replaying visits by posting those to
the message queue:</p>

                        (string)o["VisitUrl@"], 
                        pageLoadTime == null ? FSharpOption<int>.None : new FSharpOption<int>(pageLoadTime.Value),

                    visits.Add(v);
                }

                // Enumerating the heap doesn't preserve allocation order. Hence we impose an
                // order using the visit's timestamp. This allows for each visit inspection.
                foreach (var v in visits.OrderBy(v => v.Timestamp)) {
                    visitor.Post(VisitorMessage.NewVisit(v));
                }

                // Visitor mailbox processor processes messages/visits on a separate thread. 
                // We must wait for the thread to finish processing before terminating the 
                // program.
                while (true) {
                    var l = visitor.CurrentQueueLength;
                    Console.WriteLine($"Queue length: {l}");
                    Thread.Sleep(5000);

                    if (l == 0) {
                        break;
                    }
                }

                Console.ReadKey();
            }
        }
    }
}
</pre>

<p>This code fulfills our purpose, but only scratched the surface on
what's possible with ClrMD and extensions. Because we have access to
mostly the same data structures as SOS, besides walking the heap, we
could count instances of each type looking for memory leaks, inspect
the finalization queue, determine how objects root one another, and so
on. In fact, Microsoft tools such
as <a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/debugdiag">DebugDiag</a>
and
<a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/perfview">PerfView</a> make use
of ClrMD under the hood.</p>

<h4>Conclusion</h4>

<p>With the WinDbg output and object graph in mind, the code ought to
be fairly easy to follow. By having the console application share
configuration settings with the running web application, it's able to
behave as the web application with respect to replaying visits. With
the console application, we were able to replay the 423k visits,
having each visit go through the same pipeline as current visits. In a
way, we've used the memory dump as a message queue persistence
mechanism.</p>
