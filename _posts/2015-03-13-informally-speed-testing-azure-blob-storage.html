<p>As part of a migration from on-premise to Azure cloud, we have to
decide between (1) physically shipping a disk containing a few
terabytes of database backups to Microsoft, and have Microsoft upload
the disk's content to Azure blob storage, or (2) upload the contents
ourselves. Once in Azure blob storage, the database backups are to be
extracted and restored on multiple MS SQL servers to finalize the
migration.</p>

<h2>Setup</h2>

<p>As a crude measure of the upload and download capacity of Azure
blob storage, we setup a storage account in North Europe with locally
redundant replication. Inside the account, we added a default
container and fetched the primary access key to include in the
connection string below.</p>

<p>Now we're able to upload and download blobs of configurable
sizes:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint lang-cs">
// reference WindowsAzure.Storage NuGet package
using System;
using Microsoft.WindowsAzure.Storage;
using System.Diagnostics;

namespace AzureBlobStorageSpeedTest {
    class Program {
        const int Megabyte = 1024 * 1024;
        const int Megabit = 1000 * 1000;

        static double Time(Action toMeasure) {
            var w = new Stopwatch();
            w.Start();
            toMeasure();
            w.Stop();
            return w.ElapsedMilliseconds / 1000.0;            
        }

        static void Main(string[] args) {
            var sizeInMegabytes = int.Parse(args[0]);
            var contentLength = sizeInMegabytes * Megabyte;
            var randomizedContent = new byte[contentLength];
            new Random().NextBytes(randomizedContent);

            var account = CloudStorageAccount.Parse(
                "DefaultEndpointsProtocol=https;" +
                "AccountName=azurespeedtestpost;" +
                "AccountKey=OsgbBQ+nkuT0CRjbhyZ0dK3aIvpkDltEdQ3xvuCBsJlZThRFVEIJ6zXz050BENnw/c6aaVeOrCKz/oNM5UYAeQ==");
            var client = account.CreateCloudBlobClient();
            client.DefaultRequestOptions.ParallelOperationThreadCount = 24;
            var container = client.GetContainerReference("default");
            var blob = container.GetBlockBlobReference("test-" + DateTime.Now);

            var uploadTime = Time(() => blob.UploadFromByteArray(randomizedContent, 0, contentLength));
            var downloadTime = Time(() => blob.DownloadRangeToByteArray(randomizedContent, 0, 0, contentLength));

            Console.WriteLine(
                "{0} megabytes uploaded in {1:0.0} seconds at {2:0.0} megabits/second\r\n" +
                "{0} megabytes downloaded in {3:0.0} seconds at {4:0.0} megabits/second",
                sizeInMegabytes, uploadTime, contentLength / uploadTime * 8 / Megabit,
                downloadTime, contentLength / downloadTime * 8 / Megabit);
        }
    }
}
</pre>

<p>Note how the application allocates a byte array of the designated
size in megabytes. To avoid out of memory exceptions, make sure to
compile the application in 64 bit mode to get around the 2GB address
space limitation of 32 bit Windows processes.</p>

<h2>Execution</h2>

<p>Running the speed test application on a Windows 2012 Azure virtual
machine, here's an average result:</p>

<pre>
%> ./AzureBlobStorageSpeedTest 1024
1024 megabytes uploaded in 51.1 seconds at 168.9 megabits/second
1024 megabytes downloaded in 140.8 seconds at 71.5 megabits/second
</pre>

<p>On a Windows 7 laptop, running outside Azure, but with a gigabit
network card and an internet connection capable of 200 megabits/second
according to <a href="http://speedtest.net">speedtest.net</a>, an
average result is as follows:</p>

<pre>
%> ./AzureBlobStorageSpeedTest 1024
1024 megabytes uploaded in 106.4 seconds at 80.7 megabits/second
1024 megabytes downloaded in 416.7 seconds at 20.6 megabits/second
</pre>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>For a content size of only a couple of terabytes, uploading is
sufficiently fast to not warrant the overhead in time and trouble of
shipping a disk to Microsoft. Even with a bandwidth of 50
megabits/second, uploading one terabyte takes about two days. And that
doesn't factor in uploading blobs in parallel -- Either from computers
on disparate networks or multiple computers on the same network. Once
in storage, the blobs can be re-assembled and the database backup
restored.</p>

<p>Lastly, don't forget that what goes up must come down. Downloading
from blob storage happens at a considerably slower pace than
uploading, but is subject to the same performance optimizations.</p>
