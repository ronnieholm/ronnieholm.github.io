<p>As a development team, we may face many challenges while diagnosing
permanent or transient network issues with services that our
application depends on. Some of these challenges include that (1)
reliable information may be hard to come by without on-demand access
to diagnostics tools such
as <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/psping.aspx">psping</a>,
<a href="http://www.telerik.com/fiddler">Fiddler</a>, or
<a href="https://www.wireshark.org">Wireshark</a>, (2) the
application's environment and those of dependent services may fall
under the jurisdiction of other teams, (3) access to dependent
services is only allowed from whitelisted server IPs, (4) the
application team can only access production by proxy of other
teams.</p>

<p>As a development team, we can address some of these challenges by
becoming less dependent on other teams. For instance, network issues
become simpler to diagnose if we build into our application the
ability to on-demand TCP or UDP ping any endpoint (address and port
number). Dependent teams may even find this feature useful as they can
trigger a connection attempt from an application to their service
while troubleshooting at their end. Incidentally, this was how we
got <a href="/blog/2016/05/18/lessons-learned-setting-up-an-iis-web-application-for-double-hop-kerberos-authentication-with-delegation">Kerberos
authentication with delegation</a> working.</p>

<p>Besides the implementation of TCP and UCP ping in our application,
this post contains Wireshark analysis which shows why and how the
pings work at the network level. Knowledge of how to read Wireshark
traces and the basics of the TCP and UDP protocols is invaluable in
diagnosing a range of issues otherwise hidden by layers of
abstraction.</p>

<h2>Communicating over network sockets</h2>

<p>A simple way to diagnose network issues is by attempting to
establish a full-duplex transport
layer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_socket">socket</a>
connection between two endpoints. As a negative test, this quickly
reveals whether the other end is incapable of receiving traffic
because no services is listening or if a router along the path is
blocking the traffic.</p>

<p>Pinging over socket is more reliable than pinging
over <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc792">ICMP</a> because
network devices may block, drop, or not prioritize ICMP over regular
traffic. Also, ICMP resides in
the <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc791">Internet layer</a>
which is host to host without port numbers. Like sockets, port numbers
are a Transport layer construct added to allow processes on separate
hosts to communicate over a virtual circuit. As we'd prefer to assert
the availability of services running on well-known ports, and not the
host itself, we must be able to ping specific ports.</p>

<p>With the Internet protocol suite in mind, think of a socket as
bridging the gap between the Transport and Internet layers. The socket
abstracts away splitting the stream of data into IP datagrams and
reassembling those at the other end, and for TCP it provides
connection orientation with reliability and flow control.</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>Most application layer protocols use UDP or TCP as their
transport. For TCP, this implies that before sending application layer
protocol specific data, it must first establish a socket connection
between two endpoints.</p>

<p>Communicating over a UDP or TCP socket generally requires protocol
operational knowledge. Requesting data from an HTTP endpoint, for
instance, we must know how to form HTTP requests and process HTTP
responses. While perhaps possible for text-based protocols, binary
protocols such as DNS or Kerberos pose a challenge. However, in most
cases, being able to establish a connection regardless of the
application layer protocol is sufficient for asserting
connectivity.</p>

<h2>Pinging a Transport Control Protocol endpoint</h2>

<p>To verify <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc793">TCP</a>
connectivity, we attempt to establish a socket connection between two
endpoints. With TCP being a connection oriented protocol, establishing
a connection indicates success.</p>

<p>Establishing a TCP socket connection requires only the following
few lines of code with configurable IP address/host name and port
number. In comments, we provide the ASP.NET MVC implementation of a
controller action for which arguments are provided by query string
parameters:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint lang-cs">
public bool /* ActionResult */ TcpPing(string host, int port) {
    using (var s = new Socket(AddressFamily.InterNetwork, SocketType.Stream, ProtocolType.Tcp)) {
        s.Connect(host, port);
        // return Content(s.Connected.ToString());
        return s.Connected;
    }
}
</pre>

<p>When the socket is connected, the method returns true. Otherwise it
returns either false or throws a SocketException.</p>

<h3>Wireshark protocol analysis</h3>

<p>To see how setting up a socket connection qualifies as a ping, and
to gain knowledge of TCP in general, we'll analyze the Wireshark trace
captured when connecting to a host. In doing so, observe how Wireshark
provides visual cues to what's captured. Any text in square bracket
indicates a Wireshark interpretation and the left square bracket along
the No. rows indicates that the packets are part of a single TCP
stream, i.e., a conversation between two endpoints throughout the
connection:</p>

<p>
<img src="/content/successful-tcp-handshake.png"/>
</p>

<p>Host A sends a TCP segment (#245) -- TCP data encapsulated in an IP
datagram -- from one of
its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ephemeral_port">ephemeral
ports</a> to port 80 on host B. We may think of A and B as client and
server, but those are application layer concepts. As far as TCP is
concerned, A and B are peers in the process of establishing a
full-duplex communication channel.</p>

<h3>Three-way connect handshake</h3>

<p>The initial segment sent from A to B has its SYNchronize control
bit set, which means it includes a random initial sequence number that
A will use in its future communications with B (more on the use of
sequence numbers in a moment).</p>

<p>In principle, B could respond to A with a segment with the
ACKnowledge control bit set, indicating that B positively acknowledges
receiving A's initial sequence number. B could then send to A a
separate segment with the SYN control bit set, including B's random
initial sequence number for use in B's future communication with
A. But to minimize the number of round-trips, B usually responds
(#255) with a single segment with both the ACK and SYN control bits
set and including B's initial sequence number.</p>

<p>A then responds with a segment (#256) with the ACK control bit set
to positively acknowledge having received B's initial sequence
number. This completed the three-way connect handshake, and with a
full-duplex connection established, application protocol specific data
can now flow in either directions. In other words, the ping is
successful.</p>

<h3>Four-way disconnect handshake</h3>

<p>Looking at the code, it's clear that we don't send any application
protocol specific data. The socket is immediately closed and disposed
of, causing A to send a segment (#257) to B with FINish and ACK (of
previous segments) control bits set. B in turn responds (#269) with
its FIN and ACK (of previous segments). Finally, A sends a segment
with an ACK (#270) for receiving B's FIN and the four-way disconnect
handshake is complete.</p>

<p>While the three-way connect handshake needs to happen as outlined,
the four-way disconnect handshake isn't always perfect and doesn't
have to be. In the ideal case, it should've consisted of the exchange
FIN/ACK, ACK, FIN/ACK, ACK, but in the trace we're missing one of the
ACKs. The exchange nonetheless is good enough for both ends to agree
on closing the connection.</p>

<h3>Reliability and flow control</h3>

<p>Let's briefly touch on the role of Sequence number (Seq),
Acknowledgment number (Ack), and Window size (Win) as shown in the
trace. These are particularly useful to understand in the context of a
larger trace.</p>

<p>TCP maintains one Sequence number per direction to identify
segments sent. It's essentially a byte counter that increments based
on bytes in the payload field of the TCP header, with a few exceptions
as stated in
the <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc793">RFC</a>. That's why
after a successful connect handshake Sequence number is always 1.</p>

<p>TCP maintains one Acknowledgement number per direction to identify
the next segments it expects to receive. Having the other party
positively acknowledge received segments is what makes TCP
reliable. If one party doesn't receive an acknowledgment, it'll
retransmit the segments sent since last acknowledgment (in practice a
few optimizations apply).</p>

<p>TCP maintains one Window size per direction to indicate the largest
number of bytes that A may send to B before B must acknowledge having
received those. B's acknowledgment comes in the form of an ACK that
includes the next sequence number which B is ready to receive. While
waiting for the ACK, A isn't allowed to send more segments. TCP
implements flow control, i.e., the ability to control the transfer
speed in either direction, by dynamically negotiating the value of
Window size based on how full the send/receive buffers are on either
end. Otherwise a fast sender could swamp a slow receiver, leading to
packet loss, retransmission, and degraded performance.</p>

<h3>Example of failed TCP ping</h3>

<p>To illustrate what connecting to a port with no service listening
looks like, here's another Wireshark trace:</p>

<p>
<img src="/content/unsuccessful-tcp-handshake.png"/>
</p>

<p>The initial SYN from A to B is as before, but because A doesn't
receive an ACK from B, a retransmission timer within A's network stack
eventually expires, causing A to resend the SYN. Again a
retransmission timer expires, and A makes a final SYN attempt after
which A gives up, resulting in .NET throwing a SocketException. Notice
how with each retry attempt, the network stack increases the
retransmission timeout period. This explains why it takes so long for
the SocketException to appear.</p>

<h2>Pinging a Universal Datagram Protocol endpoint</h2>

<p>As indicated by the length of
the <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc768">UDP RFC</a>, UDP is
essentially IP with port numbers added. Being a connectionless
protocol, we can't rely on connection setup as a proxy for success
(although an application layer protocol is free to define its own
connection orientation on top of UDP). All we can do is sent data over
the socket and hope for a response:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint lang-cs">
public int /* ActionResult */ UdpPing(string host, int port) {
    var probe = Encoding.ASCII.GetBytes("Probe");
    using (var s = new Socket(AddressFamily.InterNetwork, SocketType.Dgram, ProtocolType.Udp)) {
        s.ReceiveTimeout = 10000;
        s.Connect(host, port);
        s.Send(probe, probe.Length, SocketFlags.None);
        var receiveBuffer = new byte[1024];
        var i = s.Receive(receiveBuffer, receiveBuffer.Length, SocketFlags.None);
        // return Content(i.ToString());
        return i;
    }
}
</pre>

<p>If an endpoint receives our probe, because we may not be sending
correct application layer protocol data, the process listening at the
other end may choose to ignore us. Without build-in acknowledgment,
UDP can't tell if data is lost along the path, if the other end is
ignoring us, or if no service is listening. In either case the ping
fails.</p>

<p>Pinging Google's DNS server on well-known port 53, the Wireshark
trace looks as follows:</p>

<p>
<img src="/content/unsuccessful-udp-against-port-53.png"/>
</p>

<p>In this case we know the Google DNS service is listening and that
it's ignoring us. The message displayed about the malformed packet is
Wireshark interpreting what it assumes is a valid DNS request. But the
serialized form of "Probe" isn't a valid DNS request.</p>

<p>Switching to port 54, where no process is listening, we see that
Wireshark no longer attempts to interpret the packet as anything but
raw UDP. Sill, there's no sign of whether the probe arrived at the
destination:</p>

<p>
<img src="/content/unsuccessful-udp-against-port-54.png"/>
</p>

<p>Some UDP based application layer protocols may actually respond to
a malformed request. But generally not being able to distinguish
between lost, ignored, or no service, UDP ping isn't particularly
useful.</p>

<h2>Scripted ping of many hosts on many ports</h2>

<p>The following PowerShell script automates calling our ping endpoint
while pinging many hosts on many ports, and generating a table with
the results. The script triggers server generated pings from any
machine with access to the acme.net diagnostics controller. In one
real-world example of troubleshooting Kerberos with delegation, the
list of hosts were domain controllers and the list of ports the ones
required for Kerberos to operate:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
$hosts = (
    "8.8.8.8",   <# Google DNS #>
    "google.com" <# Other Google server #>)

$tcpPorts = (
    53, <# DNS #>
    80  <# HTTP #>)
        
# UseDefaultCredentials required when the endpoint disallows anonymous access
$wc = New-Object System.Net.WebClient -Property @{ "UseDefaultCredentials" = "true" }

foreach ($h in $hosts) {    
    Write-Host -NoNewLine "$($h):`t"
    foreach ($p in $tcpPorts) {
        $c = ""
        try {
            $u = "https://acme.net/service/diagnostics/tcpping?host=$($h)&port=$($p)"
            $s = $wc.DownloadString($u)
            if ($s -eq "True") { $c = "green" } else { $c = "yellow" }
        } catch {
            $c = "red"
        }
        Write-Host -NoNewLine -ForegroundColor ${c} "${p} "
    }
    Write-Host ""
}
</pre>

<p>Running the script, it generates a hosts by ports matrix with each
element indicating the connection status:</p>

<pre style="background-color: #012456; width: 300px">
<span style="color: #EEEDF0;">%> .\test.ps1</span>
<span style="color: #EEEDF0;">8.8.8.8:    </span><span style="color: #00ff00;">53</span> <span style="color: #ff0000;">80</span>
<span style="color: #EEEDF0;">google.com: </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">53</span> <span style="color: #00ff00;">80</span>
</pre>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>While implementing TCP and UDP ping is simple, understanding how
and why it works requires knowledge of the Internet protocol
stack. Knowing what success and failure looks like from Wireshark's
point of view is useful in diagnosing a multitude of network issue,
not explicit related to socket setup. It allows us to treat what goes
on at the lower network layers as less of a black box.</p>
