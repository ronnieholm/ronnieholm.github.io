Part 5: SQL Server heartbeat pings and lock contention analysis with build-in tools
</p>

<p>In
the <a href="/blog/2017/07/19/debugging-recurring-web-farm-outages-analyzing-the-memory-dump-with-windbg">previous</a>
post, we debugged the OLE DB driver used by native code SharePoint to
communicate with MS SQL Server. It turns out that worker thread pool
threads block on the call to proc_AddAuditEntry, the stored procedure
responsible for writing audit log entries to the content
database. This procedure records the request before actual content is
fetched.</p>

<p>In this post we develop a SQL Server heartbeat tool to measure
general database availability. Then we use build-in SQL Server
commands to determine what causes proc_AddAuditEntry to block.</p>

<h4>Collecting SQL Server heartbeat pings</h4>

<p>Much akin to
the <a href="/blog/2017/07/16/debugging-recurring-web-farm-outages-establishing-context-with-http-heartbeat-pings">HTTP
heartbeat ping tool</a>, we wish to issue periodic requests to MS SQL
Server to gauge its uptime. That way we can tell if the issue is local
to proc_AddAuditEntry or if the database (or server) is experiencing
symptoms of instability.</p>

<p>The HTTP heartbeat and SQL Server heartbeat tools are structurally
identical. The latter periodically connects to SQL server and executes
a fixed query, but not on the AuditData table. As native code
SharePoint connects using OLE DB, the tool executes the same query
using both ADO.NET and OLE DB, just in case there's an issue with OLE
DB only:</p>

<p>Setting up the SQL Server heartbeat tool to run on the reference
laptop, the SQL Server, and Web front-end Server 2, we waited for the
HTTP heartbeat tool to report SharePoint down. That happened between
July 20, 22:47:04 and July 21, 00:18:06. SQL Server heartbeats were
unaffected, supporting an earlier observation of SharePoint 12 hive
log files showing database activity when HTTP-based SharePoint is
down.</p>

<p>The finding of SharePoint down and SQL Server up points in the
direction of contention around the audit log. What proc_AddAuditEntry
does is actually straightforward. With the exception of DocLocation,
the procedure inserts its arguments as-is into the AuditData
table:</p>

<pre style="overflow: auto; word-wrap: normal; white-space: pre;">
INSERT INTO AuditData (SiteId, ItemId, ItemType, UserId, MachineName, MachineIp, 
                       DocLocation, LocationType, <font color="red">Occurred</font>, Event, 
                       EventName, EventSource, SourceName, EventData)
       VALUES (@SiteId, @ItemId, @ItemType, @UserId, @MachineName, @MachineIp, 
               @Location, @LocationType, <font color="red">@Occurred</font>, @Event, 
               @EventName, @EventSource, @SourceName, @EventData)
</pre>

<p>The audit log is known
for <a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/subhajitc/2009/05/20/tip-the-untold-story-of-audit-logs-in-sharepoint">high-frequency
inserts and rapid growth</a>. Especially on an intranet where full
audit logging has been enabled since 2010 and where the audit log has
never been trimmed. Not only does the AuditData table itself hold a
very large amount of data, but the storage required for its two
indices, AuditData_OnSiteOccurredEvent and AuditData_OnSiteItem, is
also significant:</p>

<pre style="overflow: auto; word-wrap: normal; white-space: pre;">
<font color="green">sp_spaceused AuditData</font>

name       rows         reserved        data             index_size     unused
AuditData  <font color="red">500,797,831</font>  179,610,816 KB  <font color="red">144,268,664 KB</font>   <font color="red">34,772,344 KB</font>  569,808 KB
</pre>

<p>To measure the typical activity pattern around the AuditData table,
we summarize hourly inserts across two days. Keep in mind that the
Occurred field is in UTC, two hours behind local time:</p>

<pre style="overflow: auto; word-wrap: normal; white-space: pre;">
<font color="green">select count(*) 
from AuditData (nolock)
where Occurred >= '2017-07-20 00:00' and 
      Occurred < '2017-07-20 01:00'</font>

</pre>

<p>For the whole hour of 23-00 local time of each day (21-22 UTC), we
know SharePoint is down. Clearly, a correlation exists between inserts
on AuditData and downtimes.</p>

<h4>Investigating lock contention on AuditData</h4>

<p>Short of scripting period monitor calls, the
most <a href="https://blog.wsol.com/sql-server-locks-blocked-processes-and-two-easy-ways-to-find-them">straightforward
way to view locks in MS SQL Server</a> is the Activity Monitor, the
Log File View, the sp_who2 stored procedure, and the dm_tran_locks
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/system-dynamic-management-views/system-dynamic-management-views">dynamic
management view</a>. Below we see the output of sp_who2 shortly after
SharePoint goes offline between July 21, 22:47:38 and July 22,
00:20:43:</p>

<pre style="overflow: auto; word-wrap: normal; white-space: pre;">
<font color="green">sp_who2 'active'</font>

Cleaned up output:
SPID  Status     HostName   BlkBy   DBName                  Command      LastBatch       ProgramName
 <font color="red">906</font>  RUNNABLE   WFE4               SP_Intranet_Content_01  ALTER INDEX  07/21 22:45:38  .Net SqlClient Data Provider
<font color="red">1011</font>  SUSPENDED  ADMIN       <font color="red"> 906</font>   SP_Intranet_Content_01  INSERT       07/21 22:47:33  Internet Information Services
 348  SUSPENDED  WFE1        <font color="red">1011</font>   SP_Intranet_Content_01  INSERT       07/21 22:47:38  Internet Information Services
 353  SUSPENDED  WFE1        <font color="red">1011</font>   SP_Intranet_Content_01  INSERT       07/21 22:47:43  Internet Information Services
 197  SUSPENDED  WFE2        <font color="red">1011</font>   SP_Intranet_Content_01  INSERT       07/21 22:47:43  Internet Information Services
</pre>

<p>At 22:45:38 an alter index command comes in from Web front-end
server 4. It causes the next insert to blocks as indicated by SPID 906
in the BlkBy column. Later inserts block on the first insert, and keep
queuing up. Starting 22:56:22 and ending 23:35:02, on nine occasions,
according to the SQL Server Log File Viewer, SPID 906 was killed by
the management process. When this happens, sp_who2 change to report
SPID 906 as follows:</p>

<pre style="overflow: auto; word-wrap: normal; white-space: pre;">
SPID  Status    HostName   BlkBy  DBName                  Command          LastBatch       ProgramName
<font color="red">906</font>   ROLLBACK  WFE4              SP_Intranet_Content_01  <font color="red">KILLED/ROLLBACK</font>  07/21 22:45:38  .Net SqlClient Data Provider
</pre>

<p>While rollback is in progress, inserts remain blocked on SPID
906. Once rollback is complete, and the lock on alter index is
released, queued inserts are executed against the AuditData
table. That explains why (some) audit log entries eventually show up
in the table. Under these circumstances, SharePoint records false
audit log entries. Because once the insert finally completes, the HTTP
client originally asking for the page has likely disconnected.</p>

<p>From the output of sp_who2 alone we cannot be certain that what
we're looking at are operations against AuditData. To confirm, we must
query dm_tran_locks, holding details about locks being held and
requested:

<pre style="overflow: auto; word-wrap: normal; white-space: pre;">
<font color="green">select * from sys.dm_tran_locks</font>

Cleaned up output:
request_session_id  resource_subtype  resource_associated_entity_id  request_mode  request_type  request_status

1011                                  <font color="red">1826105546</font>                     IX            LOCK          WAIT
 348                                  <font color="red">1826105546</font>                     IX            LOCK          WAIT
 353                                  <font color="red">1826105546</font>                     IX            LOCK          WAIT
 197                                  <font color="red">1826105546</font>                     IX            LOCK          WAIT

<font color="green">select * from sys.objects where object_id = <font color="red">1826105546</font></font>

Cleaned up output:
name       object_id   type  type_desc   create_date
AuditData  <font color="red">1826105546</font>  U     USER_TABLE  2010-05-12 15:45:05.160
</pre>

<p>The dm_tran_locks output confirms that SPID 906 is granted a lock
because of an index_operation and that other requests are waiting for
the lock to be released. The request_mode
(<a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms175519.aspx">request
lock mode</a> in full) of Sch-M is short for schema modification. A
lock of type Sch-M prevents concurrent access to the table, meaning
that Sch-M blocks inserts.</p>

<p>In addition, a few times during the downtime and later at 00:24:34
and 00:52:46, the Log File Viewer displays messages indicating that
the I/O subsystem is overloaded. This is likely due to the large sizes
of the table and its indices:</p>

<pre style="overflow: auto; word-wrap: normal; white-space: pre;">
SQL Server has encountered <font color="red">1699 occurrence(s) of I/O requests taking
longer than 15 seconds to complete</font> on file
[D:\MSSQL\DATA\SP_Intranet_Content_01.mdf:MSSQL_DBCC116] in database
[SP_Intranet_Content_01] (116).  The OS file handle is
0x0000000000000A24.  The offset of the latest long I/O is:
0x00003781ada000
</pre>

<h4>Investigating SharePoint timer jobs on WFE4</h4>

<p>Let's have a look at WFE4, the host from which the alter index
request originates. With the client listed as ".Net SqlClient Data
Provider", it's probably one of SharePoint's timer jobs. In Central
Administration, under Timer Job Status, one job stands out. Below is
what its status looks like during the downtime. On the following day
of July 22, however, the Timer Job status page lists that very same
job as succeeded with progress at 100%. Perhaps the timer job attempts
a number of re-runs and one succeeds:</p>

<pre style="overflow: auto; word-wrap: normal; white-space: pre;">
Job Title            Server        Status  Progress  Started
Database Statistics  WFE4     Initialized  0%        <font color="red">7/21/2017 10:45 PM</font>
</pre>

<p>The <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc678870(v=office.12).aspx">purpose
of the Database Statistics job</a> is to
<a href="http://www.sqlmvp.org/use-update-statistics-command-in-ms-sql-server">update
query statistics</a> for main tables inside the content database. On
SQL Server 2008 Enterprise Edition, which the farm is running, the job
rebuilds <i>most</i> (for some unknown definition of most) indices
online, i.e., without taking an exclusive lock on the table. The
Database statistics timer job works by calling the
proc_UpdateStatistics stored procedure. The stored procedure contains
lines such as the following for each main table:</p>

<pre style="overflow: auto; word-wrap: normal; white-space: pre;">
update statistics AuditData with resample
</pre>

<p>According to a support article, proc_UpdateStatistics
is <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/3103194/outdated-database-statistics-decrease-sharepoint-server-performance--c">
unreliable when run in parallel with a database backup</a>. No
database appears to be taking place at the same time, though. Also,
the support article mentions that the Database Statistics job logs
operational status codes to SharePoint's 12 hive log. Yet the log on
WFE4 contains no matching entries.</p>

<h4>Conclusion</h4>

<p>Perhaps unsurprising by now, the AuditData table requires
trimming. For that purpose, the stsadm command supports
the <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc706879.aspx">Trimauditlog</a>
operation. It must be used judiciously and incrementally as the very
act of trimming acquires a lock which for longer runs can take down
SharePoint. Another side effect of trimming is transaction log
bloat.</p>

<p>Only with SharePoint 2010 and later does Central Administration
allow for the specification of a number of days to retain audit log
entries and a file location to store entries into prior to
trimming.</p>
