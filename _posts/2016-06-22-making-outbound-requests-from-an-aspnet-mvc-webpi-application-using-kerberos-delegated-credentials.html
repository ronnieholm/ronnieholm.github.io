Part 3: Making outbound requests from an ASP.NET MVC/WebAPI application using Kerberos delegated credentials
</p>

<p>In an earlier post
on <a href="http://bugfree.dk/blog/2016/05/18/lessons-learned-setting-up-an-iis-web-application-for-double-hop-kerberos-authentication-with-delegation">troubleshooting
Kerberos authentication with delegation</a>, we relied on
<a href="http://www.iis.net/downloads/community/2009/06/delegconfig-v2-beta-delegation-kerberos-configuration-tool">DelegConfig</a>
to verify the end to end authentication flow. In reality, a custom
ASP.NET MVC/WebAPI application would replace DelegConfig in making
calls to a Kerberos enabled end-system. For an application to use
Kerberos authentication, obviously the infrastructure must be properly
configured. But that doesn't mean the application will automatically
use Kerberos with delegation.</p>

<h2>Problem</h2>

<p>This post develops the code needed for a web application to call
into an end-system as its calling user, i.e., ensure the inbound and
outbound credentials remain the same. For privilege escalation, where
inbound and outbound credentials need to differ, we develop a way to
escape Kerberos delegation and execute code with custom
credentials.</p>

<p>To show the switching of outbound credentials in action, we use a
who-am-I API exposed by the end-system. We make SharePoint return the
identity of the calling user to the service which displays the
identity in the browser. The code responsible for switching
credentials, however, isn't restricted to SharePoint, but works with
any Kerberos enabled end-system.</p>

<p>Without Kerberos authentication with delegation, we would most
likely have to fall-back on the trusted subsystem model. The service
would take care of authenticating visitors, but then use a service
account to communicate with the end-system. With SharePoint, if the
service were to perform a search, no user specific security trimming
would be applied to the result. Depending on the data we store in
SharePoint, this may or may not pose a problem.</p>

<h2>Initial solution</h2>

<p>Let's see if we can experiment our way toward a solution. As a
first attempt, we wrap the instantiation of ClientContexts in a
factory (although it later turns out not be a viable solution). The
factory collects, in a single place, the details of creating contexts
with different authentication settings. The ClientContext itself acts
like a proxy for operations performed against SharePoint. Other
end-systems would likely expose similar APIs, or
use <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.net.webclient">WebClient</a>,
<a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.net.httpwebrequest">HttpWebRequest</a>,
or friends directly:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint lang-cs">
// To make the code compile, add a NuGet referece to Microsoft.SharePointOnline.CSOM.
public class ClientContextFactory {
    public WindowsImpersonationContext ImpersonationContext { get; private set; }

    // Doesn't always return a context using app pool credentials as per
    // the reverse engineered code below. It's effectively a special case
    // of passing the app pool account's username, password, and domain
    // to WithSpecificUser.
    public ClientContext WithDefaultUser(string url) => new ClientContext(url);

    // Will always create a context with credentials from the passed
    // username, password, and domain.
    public ClientContext WithSpecificUser(string url, string username, string password, string domain) {
        return new ClientContext(url) {
            Credentials = new NetworkCredential(username, password, domain)
        };
    }

    // Impersonation relies on the Impersonate method to carry out a side
    // effect, which is to change the application/thead local DefaultCredentials.
    public ClientContext WithKerberosDelegation(string url) {
        var httpContext = System.Web.HttpContext.Current;
        var identity = httpContext.User.Identity as WindowsIdentity;
        ImpersonationContext = WindowsIdentity.Impersonate(identity.Token);

        // ClientContext constructor call appears identical to the one in
        // WithApplicationPool. But because the previous impersonation code
        // carries out a side effect on the application/thread local
        // credentials used by ClientContext, the outcome is different.
        return new ClientContext(url);
    }
}
</pre>

<p>Next, making who-am-I requests using the factory created
ClientContexts, we can observe the effect of each authentication
setting on the outbound credentials. For reasons which will become
clear in a moment, we introduce an AcmeBaseController base controller
to host shared logic:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint lang-cs">
public class AcmeBaseController : Controller {
    protected string WhoAmI(ClientContext ctx) {
        var user = ctx.Web.CurrentUser;
        ctx.Load(user);
        ctx.ExecuteQuery();
        return user.LoginName;
    }
}
    
public class HomeController : AcmeBaseController {
    public ActionResult AuthenticationTest(string targetUrl) {
        var factory = new ClientContextFactory();
        var content = "";

        // WithDefaultUser: i:0#.w|acmecorp\appPoolUser
        using (var ctx = factory.WithDefaultUser(targetUrl)) {
            content += $"WithDefaultUser: {WhoAmI(ctx)}&ltbr/&gt;";
        }

        // WithSpecificUser: i:0#.w|acmecorp\serviceUser
        using (var ctx = factory.WithSpecificUser(targetUrl, "serviceUser", "servicePassword", "acmecorp")) {
            content += $"WithSpecificUser: {WhoAmI(ctx)}&ltbr/&gt;";
        }

        // WithKerberosDelegation: i:0#.w|acmecorp\callingUser
        using (var ctx = factory.WithKerberosDelegation(targetUrl)) {
            content += $"WithKerberosDelegation: {WhoAmI(ctx)}&ltbr/&gt;";

            // If we forget to call Undo, the code that follows continue to
            // execute as the impersonated user.
            factory.ImpersonationContext.Undo();
        }

        // WithDefaultUser: i:0#.w|acmecorp\appPoolUser
        using (var ctx = factory.WithDefaultUser(targetUrl)) {
            content += $"WithDefaultUser: {WhoAmI(ctx)}&ltbr/&gt;";
        }

        return Content(content);
    }
}
</pre>

<p>As shown, the ClientContext created by WithKerberosDelegation does
indeed pass along the calling credentials to the end-system. But we
must remember to call Undo to revert back to the original credentials
or we'll keep executing using the calling credentials. Inside the
factory, impersonation happens as a side effect of calling
WindowsIdentity.Impersonate. It means that ClientContext instances
created by the factory aren't isolated from each other, turning the
use of a factory into a bad design choice.</p>

<p>The ClientContext implementation takes advantage of the side effect
which happens as a result of calling
WindowsIdentity.Impersonate. Inside the
Microsoft.SharePoint.Client.Runtime.dll, it's the
ClientRuntimeContext's SetupRequestCredential method which determines
the outbound credentials used when calling the
_vti_bin/client.svc/ProcessQuery endpoint (most CSOM operations takes
place against this endpoint). With AuthenticationMode set to Default,
not setting the ClientContext's Credentials property during
construction, it defaults to CredentialCache.DefaultCredentials:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint lang-cs">
public class ClientRuntimeContext : IDisposable {
    public static void SetupRequestCredential(ClientRuntimeContext context, HttpWebRequest request) {
        // ...
        } else if (context.AuthenticationMode == ClientAuthenticationMode.Default) {
            if (context.Credentials == null) {
                request.Credentials = CredentialCache.DefaultCredentials;
            } else {
                request.Credentials = context.Credentials;
            }
        }
        // ...
    }
}
</pre>

<p>According to MSDN,
<a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.net.credentialcache.defaultcredentials">CredentialCache.DefaultCredentials</a>
serves the following purpose:</p>

<p><i>DefaultCredentials represents the system credentials for the
current security context in which the application is running. For a
client-side application, these are usually the Windows credentials
(user name, password, and domain) of the user running the
application. For ASP.NET applications, the default credentials are the
user credentials of the logged-in user [the application pool account],
or the user being impersonated [as set by our code above].
</i></p>

<h2>Improved solution</h2>

<p>Looking back at AuthenticationTest, by default code is executing
using privileged app pool credentials. We have to explicitly
transition to the less privileged calling user's credentials. Also,
using the app pool account like this assumes that it's been added to a
high-trust security group within the end-system. In fact, even though
it may not be required for most operations, the app pool account must
be added to a security group representing the maximum privilege level
needed across any operation the service is to perform.</p>

<p>With respect to the end-system, if we assume that most calling
users are less privileged than the app pool account, executing code
under the calling user's credentials and only switch to privileged
credentials as needed -- and without interfering with previous
credentials -- would be better.</p>

<p>By adding constructor code to the base controller, we can make code
inside ASP.NET MVC/WebAPI controller actions start executing using the
calling user's credentials:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint lang-cs">
public class AcmeBaseController : Controller {
    // WhoAmI the same as before
  
    public AcmeBaseController() {
        var httpContext = System.Web.HttpContext.Current;
        var identity = httpContext.User.Identity as WindowsIdentity;
        WindowsIdentity.Impersonate(identity.Token);
    }
}

public class HomeController : AcmeBaseController {
    public ActionResult AuthenticationTest(string targetUrl) {
        var content = "";

        // WithDefaultUser: i:0#.w|acmecorp\callingUser
        using (var ctx = new ClientContext(targetUrl)) {                
            content += $"WithDefaultUser: {WhoAmI(ctx)}&lt;br/&gt;";
        }

        // WithSpecificUser: i:0#.w|acmecorp\serviceUser
        using (var ctx = new ClientContext(targetUrl) { Credentials = new NetworkCredential("serviceUser", "servicePassword", "acmeCorp") }) {
            content += $"WithSpecificUser: {WhoAmI(ctx)}&lt;br/&gt;";
        }

        // WithDefaultUser: i:0#.w|acmecorp\callingUser
        using (var ctx = new ClientContext(targetUrl)) {
            content += $"WithDefaultUser: {WhoAmI(ctx)}&lt;br/&gt;";
        }

        return Content(content);
    }
}
</pre>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Calling the modified AuthenticationTest, code now defaults to run
under the calling user's credentials, yet may switch to execute as a
specific user.</p>
