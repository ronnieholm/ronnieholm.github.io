<p>(Code for this post is available
on <a href="https://github.com/ronnieholm/ExpressionParsers/tree/master/RecursiveDescentParser.CSharp">GitHub</a>.)</p>
  
<p>This post describes a backtracking lexer and combined recursive
descent <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LL_parser">LL(1)</a>
parser and evaluator for mathematical expressions. We show how to stay
with recursive descent, even for arbitrary operator precedence and
associativity. There's no need to switch
to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shunting-yard_algorithm">Shunting
Yard</a>
or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pratt_parser">Pratt</a>
parsing algorithms or
to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yacc">Yacc</a>. All that's
required is a small change to the grammar and parser for recursive
descent to support left and right associative operators and precedence
levels.</p>

<p>With recursive descent, grammar and parser follow from each
other. The two are isomorphic, leading to easy to understand, easy to
an debug, and easy to extend parser. Once we know how to parse an
expression with precedence and associativity rules, the techniques
carry over to more involved grammars like those of programming
languages.</p>

<h3>Textbook expression grammar</h3>

<p>Below is a starting point
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backus%E2%80%93Naur_form">Backus-Naur
Form</a> grammar for expressions. We'll evolve it into a grammar and
parser with support for additional precedence levels, for left and
right associative operators, and for integers and floats:</p>

<pre>
Expression = Term | Expression "+" Term | Expression "-" Term
Term = Factor | Term "*" Factor | Term "/" Factor 
Factor = Power | Factor "^" Power
Power = Integer | "(" Expression ")"
Integer = Digit | Integer Digit    
Digit = "0" | "1" | "2" | "3" | "4" | "5" | "6" | "7" | "8" | "9" 
</pre>

<p>A couple of points to note about the grammar:</p>

<p>
<ul>
<li>The grammar is LL(1), meaning that a parser would consume tokens
left to right. When a list of tokens match a grammar rule, the parser
groups these using
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Context-free_grammar#Derivations_and_syntax_trees">leftmost
derivation</a>, corresponding to left associativity.</li>
<li>The number one in parentheses refers to the grammar rules defined
in such a way that looking at most one token ahead, but without
consuming it, the parser can unambiguously identify a single matching
grammar rule.</li>
<li>Whether a grammar rule's self-reference is to the left or right of
the operator determines associativity of that operator.</li>
<li>The order of grammar rules define the order of precedence among
operators.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>Grammar rule names come from the domain described by the
grammar. Here <a href="https://study.com/academy/lesson/parts-of-an-expression-terms-factors-coefficients.html">algebra</a>
where a term is an operand involving addition or subtraction and
factor an operand involving multiplication or division. Names might as
well have been Addition and Multiplication or simply Rule0, Rule1,
RuleN with N denoting the rule's precedence level.</p>

<p>A lexer operates at the character level, grouping characters into
tokens, and would typically implement the Integer and Digit
rules. Single token lookahead refers to the operation of the parser
and not the lexer. The lexer may look many characters ahead. While
inside a number, only looking at the next digit, the lexer has no way
to tell whether the number is an integer or float. In fact, that's a
common reason for separating lexing and parsing, simplifying the
parser.</p>

<h3>Adjusting grammar for off-by-one naming</h3>

<p>Grammar rules appear off-by-one: Expression is about addition and
subtraction, Term is about multiplication and division, and so on. If
instead we expand the first rule into two, we end up with Term,
Factor, and so on aligned. The extra rule we name Primary:</p>

<pre>
Expression = Term
Term = Factor | Term "+" Factor | Term "-" Factor
Factor = Power | Factor "*" Power | Factor "/" Power
Power = Primary | Power "^" Primary
Primary = Integer | "(" Expression ")"
</pre>
 
<p>Rewriting rules is valid because a grammar comprising of rules A =
B and B = C | D is identical to A = B | C | D.</>

<h3>Adjusting grammar for right associativity</h3>

<p>For right associative operators, we can apply another grammar
rewrite rule. With Power for instance, it must be rewritten to Primary
"^" Power. Power must go on the right, resulting in rightmost
derivation and hence right associativity.</p>

<p>Even though the grammar with left and right self-references
captures precedence and associativity, a left self-reference causes a
recursive descent parser to enter an infinite loop. With Term for
instance, the parser would keep calling itself without consuming
tokens.</p>

<h3>Eliminating left recursion through EBNF rule rewriting</h3>

<p>This is where
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_Backus%E2%80%93Naur_form">Extended
BNF</a> comes in. It introduces { x } rule syntax for x repeated zero
or more times. A parser would implement such repetition with a loop
instead of recursion. Rewriting the grammar to the new syntax and
including unary minus and float support, we end up with the grammar
below. Names such as Addition, Multiplication, and Power are short for
operators with addition, multiplication, and power-like
precedence:</p>

<pre>
Expression = Addition
Addition = Multiplication {("+" | "+") Multiplication}
Multiplication = Power {("*" | "/") Power}
Power = Unary {"^" Power}
Unary = '-' Unary | Primary
Primary = Integer | Float | "(" Expression ")"
</pre>

<p>Instead of substituting left recursion with iteration, we could
rewrite the grammar as all right recursive. The parser could then
apply a transformation upon evaluating left associative operators or
to
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree">Abstract
Syntax Tree</a> (AST) nodes, depending on the parser's output. While
possible, it's unnecessarily difficult.</p>

<h3>From grammar rules to parser</h3>

<p>A two-way mapping exists between grammar and recursive descent
parser, turning each rule into a parse method and vice versa. The
inside of each parse method follows from the rule's definition as per
Wirth's recipe for translating EBNF into code (see Additional
references below). Placing a breakpoint on a parse method, the call
stack reveals the path from Expression to that parse method, showing
the close relationship between grammar and parser.</p>

<p>To keep
the <a href="https://github.com/ronnieholm/ExpressionParsers/tree/master/RecursiveDescentParser.CSharp">implementation</a>
simple, evaluation happens during parsing. Instead of each parse
method returning an AST node as with
the <a href="https://github.com/ronnieholm/ExpressionParsers/tree/master/ShuntingYardParser.CSharp">Shunting
Yard implementation</a>, each parse method returns the numeric result
of the computation so far.</p>

<p>Below is a trace from parsing and evaluating an expression. Enter
marks an entry into a parse method (20 in total) and the value of the
current token. Exit marks the return from a parse method and the value
passed up the call chain:</p>

<pre>

                        Exit: Value: 0.5
                    Exit: Value: 2
                Exit: Value: 9
                Enter: ParsePower, Value: 5
                    Enter: ParseUnary, Value: 5
                        Enter: ParsePrimary, Value: 5
                        Exit: Value: 5

Exit: Value: 47

<p>With grammar rules mapping closely to parse methods and correct
handling of precedence and associativity, the parsing has become very
explicit.</p>

<h3>Comparing recursive descent, Shunting Yard, and Pratt parsers</h3>

<p>A recursive descent parser is the most intuitive and simplest to
implement. It dates back to the early 1960s, where it was impractical
to implement. The call stack was still a novel concept, function calls
were expensive, and stack memory scarce. These limitations led
Dijkstra to develop the Shunting Yard algorithm. It uses explicit
operator and operand stacks over the implicit call stack. Today,
unless parsing large programs with many precedence levels, recursive
descent should be the default option.</p>

<p>In 1973, Pratt developed the <a href="https://tdop.github.io">Top
Down Operator Precedence parser</a>, later called Pratt parser. It
outperforms recursive descent and Shunting Yard in that regardless of
an operator's precedence level, a Pratt parser requires a single parse
method call only. It's well suited for grammars with many levels of
precedence, and languages with dynamic operator support, where a new
operator may be added anywhere in the precedence hierarchy and with
any associativity. A similar flexibility can be built into recursive
descent by replacing or supplementing the fixed rules/parse methods
with a lookup table.</p>

<p>As an example of a hybrid of a recursive descent parser for
statements and a Pratt parser for expressions, have a look at
the <a href="https://github.com/ronnieholm/Monkey-CSharp">MonkeyLang-CSharp</a>
parser.</p>
