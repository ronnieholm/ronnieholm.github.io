  Part 3: Recursive descent parsing of mathematical expressions with C#</p>

<p>The source code for this post is extensively commented and is
available
<a href="https://github.com/ronnieholm/ExpressionParsers/tree/master/RecursiveDescentParser.CSharp">here</a>.</p>
  
<p>This post is about implementing a backtracking lexer and a
recursive
descent <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LL_parser">LL(1)</a>
parser for mathematical expressions. The LL(1) part refers to parsing
an expression left to right,
performing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Context-free_grammar#Derivations_and_syntax_trees">left-most
derivations</a> of tokens, using a single token lookahead. For
mathematical expressions, leftmost derivation implies that any
operator becomes left associative and single token lookahead implies
that taking into account the next token only, we can determine which
parsing rule to apply next. By organizing the rules by which the
parser operates from lowest to highest precedence, the parser does
operator precedence climbing to support proper operator precedence for
unary -, binary +, -, *, /, ^ operators and parenthesis.</p>

<p>The Internet is full of mathematical expression parsers because
it's the simplest non-linear parsing problem. But parsers tend to
focus on precedence only. That isn't a problem as long as we leave out
right associate operators such as unary - and binary ^. But parsing
even simple mathematical expressions requires supporting both left and
right associative operators.</p>

<p>If we can create a parser for mathematical expression supporting
operators with varying precedence <i>and</i> operators with both left
and right associativity, we can reuse the patterns to parse any
language with a single token lookahead without resorting to
third-party parsing frameworks.</p>

<h3>Textbook expression grammar</h3>

<p>Below is a textbook example of a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backus%E2%80%93Naur_form">BNF
grammar</a> for expressions. We'll evolve it into a more capable
grammar for our parser to implement:</p>

<pre>
Expression = Term | Expression "+" Term | Expression "-" Term
Term = Factor | Term "*" Factor | Term "/" Factor 
Factor = Power | Factor "^" Power
Power = Integer | "(" Expression ")"
Integer = Digit | Integer Digit    
Digit = "0" | "1" | "2" | "3" | "4" | "5" | "6" | "7" | "8" | "9" 
</pre>

<p>In our case, the lexer handles the <code>Integer</code>
and <code>Digit</code> rules. The lexer operates at the character
level whereas the parser operates and the token level, and generally
handles rules expressed by a regular language, i.e., one defined by
regular expressions. When we talk about single token lookahead, we're
referring to the operation of the parser and not the lexer. The lexer
may look any number of characters ahead.</p>

<p>To understand the grammar, it may help to brush up on terminology
from
<a href="https://study.com/academy/lesson/parts-of-an-expression-terms-factors-coefficients.html">algebra</a>. A
term refers to the operands part of an expression involving addition
or subtraction operators. A factor refers to the operands part of an
expression involving multiplication or division operators.</p>

<h3>Adjusting grammar for off-by-one naming</h3>

<p>Looking at the textbook expression grammar, the rules appear
off-by-one: the <code>Expression</code> rule is about addition and
subtraction, the <code>Term</code> rule about multiplication and
division, and so on. If instead, we rewrite, or expand, the first rule
into two, we end up with the grammar below where Terms, Factors, and
so match with their definition. Since we introduced an extra level, we
name the last rule <code>Primary</code> (and leave out lexer
rules):</p>

<pre>
Expression = Term
Term = Factor | Term "+" Factor | Term "-" Factor
Factor = Power | Factor "*" Power | Factor "/" Power
Power = Primary | Power "^" Primary
Primary = Integer | "(" Expression ")"
</pre>
 
<p>In general, a grammar <code>A = B, B = C | D</code> can be
rewritten as <code>A = B | C | D</code>. Both grammars define the same
language.</p>

<p>Replacing rule names by <code>Rule0</code>, <code>Rule1</code>,
<code>RuleN</code>, where N is the precedence level for the rule's
operator(s) makes no difference. Within a grammar, precedence arises
by one rule referencing the next in increasing order of
precedence.</p>

<p>Because in the grammar above, the rule's self-reference appears on
the left, as in
<code>Term = Term "+" Factor</code>, it's left recursive and parses
left associative operators, e.g., <code>a - b - c parses as (a - b) -
c</code>. Right associative operators dictate right recursive rules as
in <code>Primary "^" Power</code>. Unfortunately, recursive descent
parsers cannot work with left recursion. To parse <code>Term = Term
"+" Factor</code>, it would recurse into itself, leading to an
infinite loop.</p>

<h3>Eliminating left recursion with EBNF rule rewriting</h3>

<p>That's where
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_Backus%E2%80%93Naur_form">EBNF</a>
comes in. It introduces <code>{ x }</code> syntax for zero or more
iterations, expressed with a loop rather than recursion.</p>

<p><b>Side note</b>: a recursive descent parser has no issue with
right recursive rules. Thus, instead of substituting left recursive
with iterations, we could rewrite the grammar into right recursive
form and applying a transformation on
the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree">Abstract
Syntax Tree</a> (AST) nodes for left associative operators. It's
simpler to eliminating left recursion.</p>

<pre>
Expression = Term
Term = Factor { ("+" | "-") Factor }
Factor = Power { ("*" | "/")  Power }
Power = Primary { "^" Primary }
Primary = Integer | "(" Expression ")"
</pre>
    
<p>Favoring readability over compactness, and extending the grammar to
include unary minus and float support, we end up with this final
grammar:</p>

<pre>
Expression = Addition
Addition = Multiplication { ("+" | "-") Multiplication }
Multiplication = Power { ("*"|"/") Power }
Power = Unary { "^" Power }
Unary = '-' Unary | Primary
Primary = Integer | Float | "(" Expression ")"
</pre>

<p>Naming
rules <code>Addition</code>, <code>Multiplication</code>, <code>Power</code>
is short for operators with addition, multiplication, and power-like
precedence.</p>

<p><b>Side node</b>: lots of languages are LL(1) at the token level
but not the character level. In fact, one reason to separate the lexer
and parser is to allow the parser to be LL(1). For instance, lexing a
integer or float, the lexer bookmarks its current position. It then
scans the input until it encounters either a whitespace or a dot,
before it backtracks to the bookmark and calls the appropriate integer
or float lexer method.</p>

<h3>From grammar rules to parser</h3>

<p>Organizing the parser, each rule becomes a corresponding Parse
method. Placing a breakpoint inside one of these methods, the call
stack shows the path from <code>Expression</code> to the current
rule. This is useful in debugging the parser and goes to show the
one-to-one relationship between grammar and recursive descent
parser.</p>

<p>To keep
the <a href="https://github.com/ronnieholm/ExpressionParsers/tree/master/RecursiveDescentParser.CSharp">implementation</a>
focused on parsing, evaluation happens during parsing. Each parse
method could've returned AST nodes as with
the <a href="https://github.com/ronnieholm/ExpressionParsers/tree/master/ShuntingYardParser.CSharp">Shunting
Yard implementation</a> and we could've added an AST tree walking
interpreter. Both solutions work because the evaluation order is
correct with respect to associativity and precedence.</p>

<p>Below is the trace output from parsing an expression. The trace
reflects the parser's call stack with each Enter marking an entry into
a parse method, 20 in all, and the value of the current token. Exit
marks includes what each parse method returns up the call chain to its
caller.</p>

                            Exit: Value: 4
                        Exit: Value: 4
                        Enter: ParsePower, Value: 0.5

                Exit: Value: 9
                Enter: ParsePower, Value: 5
                    Enter: ParseUnary, Value: 5
                        Enter: ParsePrimary, Value: 5
                        Exit: Value: 5
                    Exit: Value: 5
                Exit: Value: 5
            Exit: Value: 45
        Exit: Value: 47
    Exit: Value: 47
Exit: Value: 47
</pre>

<p>Because the parser and the grammar rules map one-to-one, following
the grammar rules by hand, we'd arrive at the same order. Constructing
a parser from a grammar rules is a mechanical process.</p>

<h3>Comparing recursive descent, Shunting Yard, and Pratt parsers</h3>

<p>The recursive descent approach to parsing is most intuitive of
parsers. Known since the 60s, but at the time impractical to
implement. Back then, the call stack was still a novel concept,
function calls were expensive, and memory scarce, leading Dijkstra to
develop the Shunting Yard algorithm. On modern hardware, method calls
are fast and memory cheap. So unless we're parsing large programs with
many precedence levels, recursive descent is a good starting
point.</p>

<p>In 1973, Pratt developed the <a href="https://tdop.github.io">Top
Down Operator Precedence parser</a>, later called the Pratt parser. It
was an improvement on Shunting Yard in that a Pratt parser requires
only a single parse method call regardless of precedence level, making
it efficient for grammars with many levels of precedence. It's also
useful in language with the ability to add new operators at any
position in the precedence hierarchy and with any associativity. We
could replace or supplement the fixed rules of recursive descent with
a lookup table to determine next parse methods to call.</p>

<p>For an example of a hybrid of a recursive descent parser for
statements and a Pratt parser for expressions, take a look at
the <a href="https://github.com/ronnieholm/MonkeyLang">MonkeyLang</a>
parser.</p>
