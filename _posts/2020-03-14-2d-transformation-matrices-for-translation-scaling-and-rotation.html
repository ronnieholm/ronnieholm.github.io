<div id="post">
  <p>This post develops the mathematical foundation for the 2D
    elementary matrices in computer graphics used for translating,
    scaling, and rotating points. For a hands-on feel for the
    concepts, the matrices and operations on those are implemented in
    a graphics application.</p>
  
  <p>We start by defining a traditional 2D coordinate system in terms
    of (1) orthogonal vectors \(\vec u\) and \(\vec v\), representing
    \(x\) and \(y\) axis and (2) origin \(o\) representing point of
    origin, commonly \((0,0)\) where \(\vec u\) and \(\vec v\)
    intersect. Also, terms point and vector are interchangeably, but
    when explicitly talking about a point, the notation is to
    capitalize it. Think of point as a special kind of vector.
  </p>
  <p>
    A point \(P\) may be defined in terms of vectors \(\vec u\) and
    \(\vec v\). To arrive at the point from origin, we move some
    distance along \(\vec u\), then some distance along \(\vec v\),
    and offsetting with respect to origin \(O\), our point of
    reference:
  </p> 
  <p>
    $$P = x\vec u + y\vec v + O\\
    P = 0.5\vec u + 0.25\vec v + O\\
    P = 0.5\begin{bmatrix}1\\0\end{bmatrix} + 0.25\begin{bmatrix}0\\1\end{bmatrix} + \begin{bmatrix}0\\0\end{bmatrix}\\
    P = \begin{bmatrix}0.5\\0\end{bmatrix} + \begin{bmatrix}0\\0.25\end{bmatrix}\\
    P = \begin{bmatrix}0.5\\0.25\end{bmatrix}$$
    
    The fact that \(\vec u\) and \(\vec v\) are unit perpendicular
    vectors and that \(O\) is the zero vector is convention. More
    commonly \(P\) is written \((x,y) = (0.5, 0.25)\) where \(x\) and
    \(y\) are the coordinates of \(P\). Going forward, we'll write
    \(P\) in matrix form:
    
    $$P = \begin{bmatrix}x\ y\ 1\end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix}\vec u\\ \vec v\\ O \end{bmatrix} = x\vec u + y\vec v + O$$

    <!-- Difference between vector and point? In Moving objects in space, lecturer refers to first video for the difference -->

    For notational convenience we leave out \(\begin{bmatrix}\vec u\\
    \vec v\\ O \end{bmatrix}\) but in terms of the math it's still
    there. \(P\) in matrix form then becomes \(\begin{bmatrix}x\ y\
    1\end{bmatrix}\). The \(1\) is there to pick up origin \(O\). In
    order for \(P\) to be a point and not just a vector, we add a
    point to vector to get a point back.

  <h3>Translation</h3>
  <p>
    Translating a point by \(a\) in \(x\) direction and \(b\) in \(y\)
    direction may be expressed in terms of original and desired
    vectors:
  <p>
  <p>      
    $$\begin{bmatrix}x & y & 1\end{bmatrix} \rightarrow \begin{bmatrix}x + a & y + b & 1\end{bmatrix}$$      
  </p>
  <p>
    Transforming the vector on the left into the vector on the right
    means applying an operator \(T_{a,b}\) to the left side. The
    operator takes in any \(x\) and \(y\) and translates it by \(a\)
    and \(b\). Expanding the multiplication enables us to verify
    correctness of \(T_{a,b}\) matrix:
    
    $$\begin{bmatrix}x & y & 1\end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix}1 & 0 & 0\\0 & 1 & 0\\a & b & 1\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}1x + 0y + 1a & 0x + 1y + 1b & 0x + 0y + 1\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}x + a & y + b & 1\end{bmatrix}$$
    
    Two characteristics of the transformation matrices we'll encounter
    is that they're sparse and that the last column is always the same
    to pick up origin \(O\) and carry it over unchanged.
  </p>

  <h3>Scaling</h3>  
  <p>
    Scaling a point by \(a\) in \(x\) direction and \(b\) in \(y\)
    direction has the effect of shrinking (\(a < 1\)) or expanding
    (\(a > 1\)) with respect to origin. Expressed in terms of vectors:
  </p>
  <p>$$\begin{bmatrix}x & y & 1 \end{bmatrix}\rightarrow \begin{bmatrix}ax & by & 1\end{bmatrix}$$</p>
 
  <p>We define a scaling matrix \(S_{a, b}\) as

    $$\begin{bmatrix}x & y & 1\end{bmatrix}\rightarrow \begin{bmatrix}a & 0 & 0\\ 0 & b & 0\\ 0 & 0 & 1\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}ax & by & 1\end{bmatrix}$$

    Scaling only works when the center of the shape is at origin
    \(O\). This would be the case for a unit square with control
    points in \((-1,1)\), \((1,1)\), \((1,-1)\), and \((-1,-1)\), and
    scaling from a \(2 x 2\) to a \(4 x 4\) square is equal to
    applying \(S_{2, 2}\) to each control of the square.</p>
   
  <p>But if instead the unit square has control points \((1,3)\),
    \((3,3)\), \((3,1)\), and \((1,1)\), then center becomes \(2, 2\)
    and \(S_{2, 2}\) would scale as well as move the center. In that
    case, each point relative to the square's center of mass must be
    translated to origin, then scaled, and then translated back.
  </p>
  </p>    
    $$T_{-2,-2} S_{2,2} T_{2,2}$$
  </p>
  <p>
    For the simple unit square, determining the center is easy. For a
    general polygon, we'd have to calculate its center of mass.
  </p>
   
  <h3>Rotation</h3>
  
  <p>Rotating a point \(\theta\) around origin implies that distance
    \(r\), radius, between origin and \((x, y)\) and between origin
    and \((x', y')\) doesn't change:
    
    $$\begin{bmatrix}x & y & 1\end{bmatrix} \rightarrow \begin{bmatrix}x' & y' & 1\end{bmatrix}$$
    
    With radius \(r\) and angle \(\phi\) between the \(x\) axis and
    point, current position is

    $$x = r\cos\phi\\
      y = r\sin\phi$$

    The target point is then the current position \(x\) and \(y\) with
    the additional rotation by \(\theta\):

    $$\begin{eqnarray*}
      x' = r\cos(\phi + \theta) & & \\
      x' = r\cos \phi \cos \theta - r \sin \phi \sin \theta & & \textrm{\{apply identity sum: \(\cos(u + v) = \cos u \cos v - \sin u \sin v\)\}}\\
      x' = x \cos \phi - y \sin \theta & & \textrm{\{substitute in definitions of \(x\) and \(y\)\}}\\\\
      y' = r\sin(\phi + \theta) & & \\
      y' = r \sin \phi \cos \theta + r \cos \phi \sin \theta & & \textrm{\{apply identity sum: \(\sin(u + v) = \sin u \cos v + \cos u \sin v\)\}}\\
      y' = y \cos \theta + x \sin \theta & &  \textrm{\{substitute in definitions of \(x\) and \(y\)\}}
    \end{eqnarray*}$$

    Rewriting to matrix form, rotation matrix \(R_\theta\) becomes

    $$\begin{bmatrix}x & y & 1\end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix}\cos\theta & \sin\theta & 0\\ -\sin\theta & \cos\theta & 0\\ 0 & 0 & 1\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}x' & y' & 1 \end{bmatrix}$$

    As with scaling, rotation around origin is assumed. If that isn't
    the case, then we must first translate, then scale, then
    translate:

    $$T_{-a,-b} R_\theta T_{a, b}$$
  </p>
  <h3>Summary</h3>
  <p>Collectively, these matrices are known as the elementary matrices
    in computer graphics. Instead of applying these transformations
    one at a time to a point, transformation matrices may be
    multiplied together to a single matrix \(T\) applied to a point:

    $$\begin{bmatrix}x & y & 1\end{bmatrix} T \begin{bmatrix}\vec u\\
    \vec v\\ O \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}x' & y' & 1 \end{bmatrix}$$
