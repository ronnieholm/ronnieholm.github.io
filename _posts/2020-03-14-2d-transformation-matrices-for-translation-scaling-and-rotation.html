<div id="post">
  <p>This post develops the foundational matrices for translation,
    scaling, and rotation of control points forming a shape. In
    graphics applications, these elementary translation matrices
    provide an efficient and uniform way of manipulating objects on
    screen. One such demo application implementing the concepts is
    available on Github:</p>

  <h3>The orthogonal coordinate system</h3>
  
  <p>We start by formalizing a traditional 2D coordinate system. It
    may be defined in terms of (1) orthogonal vectors \(\vec u\) and
    \(\vec v\), for the \(x\) and \(y\) axis and (2) origin \(O\) for
    the point of origin. Origin is the point of intersection between
    \(\vec u\) and \(\vec v\) and is commonly \((0,0)\). The
    <a href="https://youtu.be/01YSK5gIEYQ?list=PL_w_qWAQZtAZhtzPI5pkAtcUVgmzdAP8g&t=1469">difference</a>
    between point and vector is best illustrated by a few examples:
    \(Q = P + \vec v\) and \(\vec v = Q - P\).
  </p>
  <p>
    A point \(P\) may be defined in terms of vectors \(\vec u\) and
    \(\vec v\). To arrive at \(P\) we start at origin \(O\), then move
    some distance along \(\vec u\) followed by a move some distance
    along \(\vec v\):
  </p> 
  <p>
    $$P = x\vec u + y\vec v + O\\
    P = 0.5\vec u + 0.25\vec v + O\\
    P = 0.5\begin{bmatrix}1\\0\end{bmatrix} + 0.25\begin{bmatrix}0\\1\end{bmatrix} + \begin{bmatrix}0\\0\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}0.5\\0.25\end{bmatrix}$$

    Convention dictates that \(\vec u\) and \(\vec v\) are
    perpendicular unit vectors, that \(O\) is the zero vector, and
    that \(P\) is commonly written \((x,y) = (0.5, 0.25)\) with \(x\)
    and \(y\) being the coordinates of \(P\). Going forward, we'll
    also write points in matrix form:
    
    $$P = \begin{bmatrix}x\ y\ 1\end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix}\vec u\\ \vec v\\ O \end{bmatrix} = x\vec u + y\vec v + O$$

    For brevity the 3x1 matrix is mostly left out, but computation
    wise is still there. \(P\) in matrix form is then
    \(\begin{bmatrix}x\ y\ 1\end{bmatrix}\) with \(1\) added to carry
    over origin \(O\). Applying translation, scaling, and rotation,
    \(O\) must remain unaffected.
  </p>

  <h3>Translation</h3>
  <p>
    Translating a point by \(a\) in \(x\) direction and by \(b\) in
    \(y\) direction may be expressed by the following relationship
    between source and destination vectors:
  <p>
  <p>      
    $$\begin{bmatrix}x & y & 1\end{bmatrix} \rightarrow \begin{bmatrix}x + a & y + b & 1\end{bmatrix}$$      
  </p>
  <p>
    Transforming any left matrix to a right matrix is akin to applying
    a postfix operator to the left side. With respect to translation,
    the \(T_{a,b}\) operator is matrix multiplication of the left side
    with a special translation matrix parameterized by \(a\) and
    \(b\). Expanding the multiplication allows us to verify the
    correctness of \(T_{a,b}\):
    
    $$\begin{bmatrix}x & y & 1\end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix}1 & 0 & 0\\0 & 1 & 0\\a & b & 1\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}1x + 0y + 1a & 0x + 1y + 1b & 0x + 0y + 1\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}x + a & y + b & 1\end{bmatrix}$$
    
    Translation, scaling, and rotation matrices are characterized by
    their sparseness and the last column always being the same to
    carry over origin \(O\).
  </p>

  <h3>Scaling</h3>  
  <p>
    Scaling a point by \(a\) in \(x\) direction and \(b\) in \(y\)
    direction shrinks, if \(a < 1\), or expands, if \(a > 1\), the
    point with respect to origin \(O\). The relationship between
    source and destination vectors would be the following:
  </p>
  <p>$$\begin{bmatrix}x & y & 1 \end{bmatrix}\rightarrow \begin{bmatrix}ax & by & 1\end{bmatrix}$$</p>
 
  <p>To satisfy this relationship requires a scaling matrix \(S_{a,
  b}\) as follows:

    $$\begin{bmatrix}x & y & 1\end{bmatrix}\rightarrow \begin{bmatrix}a & 0 & 0\\ 0 & b & 0\\ 0 & 0 & 1\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}ax & by & 1\end{bmatrix}$$

    Scaling works as intended when for a set of points their centroid
    \(C = O\). A unit square with control points \(S =
    \{(-1,1),(1,1),(1,-1)\}\) satisfies this condition. Applying
    \(S_{2,2}\) to each point has the effect of scaling from a 2x2 to
    a 4x4 square.</p>

  <!-- https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1801867/finding-the-centre-of-an-abritary-set-of-points-in-two-dimensions -->
  
  <p>On the other hand, a unit square with control points \(S =
    \{(1,3),(3,3),(3,1)\}\) has a centroid \(C = (2, 2)\). Applying
    \(S_{2, 2}\) to each point has the effect of scaling from a 2x2 to
    4x4 square <em>and</em> for resulting points move centroid
    \(C\). To prevent this, each point must first translated such that
    \(C = O\), scaled, and then translated back:
  </p>
  </p>    
    $$T_{-a,-b} S_{c,d} T_{a,b}$$
  </p>
  <p>
    The centroid \(C\) of a set of points, assuming each has equal
    weight, is defined as follows with above \(a = \overline{x}\) and
    \(b = \overline{y}\):

    $$\left(\overline{x},\overline{y}\right) = \left(\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_{i},\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}y_{i}\right)$$
  </p>
   
  <h3>Rotation</h3>
  
  <p>Rotating a point \(\theta\) around origin implies that distance
    \(r\), radius, between origin and \((x, y)\) and between origin
    and \((x', y')\) doesn't change:
    
    $$\begin{bmatrix}x & y & 1\end{bmatrix} \rightarrow \begin{bmatrix}x' & y' & 1\end{bmatrix}$$
    
    With radius \(r\) and angle \(\phi\) between the \(x\) axis and
    point, current position is

    $$x = r\cos\phi\\
      y = r\sin\phi$$

    The target point is then the current position \(x\) and \(y\) with
    the additional rotation by \(\theta\):

    $$\begin{eqnarray*}
      x' = r\cos(\phi + \theta) & & \\
      x' = r\cos \phi \cos \theta - r \sin \phi \sin \theta & & \textrm{\{apply identity sum: \(\cos(u + v) = \cos u \cos v - \sin u \sin v\)\}}\\
      x' = x \cos \phi - y \sin \theta & & \textrm{\{substitute in definitions of \(x\) and \(y\)\}}\\\\
      y' = r\sin(\phi + \theta) & & \\
      y' = r \sin \phi \cos \theta + r \cos \phi \sin \theta & & \textrm{\{apply identity sum: \(\sin(u + v) = \sin u \cos v + \cos u \sin v\)\}}\\
      y' = y \cos \theta + x \sin \theta & &  \textrm{\{substitute in definitions of \(x\) and \(y\)\}}
    \end{eqnarray*}$$

    Rewriting to matrix form, rotation matrix \(R_\theta\) becomes

    $$\begin{bmatrix}x & y & 1\end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix}\cos\theta & \sin\theta & 0\\ -\sin\theta & \cos\theta & 0\\ 0 & 0 & 1\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}x' & y' & 1 \end{bmatrix}$$

    As with scaling, rotation around origin is assumed. If that isn't
    the case, then we must first translate, then scale, then
    translate:

    $$T_{-a,-b} R_\theta T_{a, b}$$

    If both scaling and rotation is needed, the translation of center
    of mass to origin and back need happen only once.
  </p>
  <h3>Summary</h3>
  <p>Translation, scaling, and rotation matrices are collectively
    known as the elementary matrices in computer graphics. Rather than
    apply transformations to a point one matrix multiplication at a
    time, transformation matrices combine into a single matrix \(M\)
    for reuse across points:

    $$\begin{bmatrix}x & y & 1\end{bmatrix} M \begin{bmatrix}\vec u\\
    \vec v\\ O \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}x' & y' & 1 \end{bmatrix}$$
