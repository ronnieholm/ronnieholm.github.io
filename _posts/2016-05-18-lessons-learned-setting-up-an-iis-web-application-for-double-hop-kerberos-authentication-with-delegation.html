<div id="post">

<p>This post summarizes the lessons learned setting up an Internet
Information Services (IIS) web application
using <a href="http://www.roguelynn.com
/words/explain-like-im-5-kerberos">Kerberos</a> authentication
with <a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/autz_auth_stuff/2011/05/03/kerberos-delegation">delegation</a>. After
verifying that the prerequisites for Kerberos and IIS are satisfied, a
test web application (or service) is deployed to verify end-to-end
authentication. The service makes calls to a Kerberos-enabled
SharePoint instance, called the end-service, acting on behalf of the
calling user.</p>

<p>In terms of flow, communication from the client's browser to the
SharePoint instance and back looks like below, optionally including a
load balancer in between the client's browser and the web
app/service:</p>

<pre>
Client browser <-> Web app/service <-> SharePoint 2013 on-premise server
</pre

<p>In addition to calling SharePoint directly, this flow enables a
user to call into SharePoint through a service and have it switch
between executing as the calling user or a more privileged account. A
user with limited permissions could request the creation of a site
collection while otherwise be subject to SharePoint's build-in
authorization logic. Inside the service, only while executing with
privileged credentials are custom authorization checks required.</p>

<h2>Verifying prerequisites</h2>

<p>Before getting to the IIS part, let's first verify that Active
Directory and Kerberos with delegation have been properly
configured.</p>

<h4>Service Principal Names</h4>

<p>With <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc772815">Windows
Kerberos</a>, the Kerberos Key Distribution Center, Authentication
Service (AS), and Ticket Granting Service (TGS) are integral parts of
the domain controller. We therefore must register a one-to-many
binding with the domain controller, relating the app pool account of a
web app to an endpoint where the service is running. In Kerberos
terms, we register a Service Principal Name (SPN) for an
account. Think of a principal as the general term for a user,
computer, or service. An SPN is then a unique identifier for a service
running on a server, used by clients to locate a service.</p>

<p>Looking up, or forming, a service principal by name (endpoint) is
what enables a client to request credentials from the TGS, valid for a
particular service only. As part of these credentials is a ticket
encrypted by TGS which the client passes to the service. Only the
service is able to decrypt this ticket, thereby validating the
identity of the client by way of the ticket's content. With the
decrypted ticket in hand, and using an encryption key from inside the
ticket, the service then sends back an encrypted message to the client
that only the client will be able to decrypt.</p>

<p>By both trusting a common third-party, this Kerberos handshake
establishes mutual trust between the client and service -- between two
principals over an unsecured network. From then on, the parties can
continue to exchange encrypted messages using Kerberos encryption keys
or, more likely, the connection is already protected by Transport
Layer Security such as SSL.</p>

<p>The existence of a SPN for an app pool account can be easily
verified with the
<a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc731241.aspx">setspn</a>
command which, despite its name, is used for
both <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/sv-se/library/cc755413">setting
and querying principals</a>. While a domain administrator must have
made a prior call to setspn to create the principal, any computer
within the domain can query:</p>

<pre>
%&gt; setspn &lt;domain&gt;\&lt;app-pool-account&gt;
Registered ServicePrincipalNames for CN=&lt;app-pool-account&gt;,OU=AD,OU=ServiceAccounts,OU=AcmeCorp,DC=&lt;domain&gt;,DC=local:
    HTTP/&lt;my-server-1&gt;.&lt;domain&gt;.local
    HTTP/&lt;my-server-1&gt;
    HTTP/&lt;my-server-2&gt;.&lt;domain&gt;.local
    HTTP/&lt;my-server-2&gt;
</pre>

<p>The output reveals that four service principal names have been
associated with the app pool account. It's common for an endpoint to
have two registered principals matching DNS host name and NetBIOS
name, respectively. In other words, our service could be deployed to
either or both servers listed above.</p>

<h4>Delegation</h4>

<p>Now, let's verify the app pool account's ability to not only
receive and process, but also delegate Kerberos tickets, i.e., call
another service on the calling user's behalf.</p>

<p>The intermediary service acting on behalf of a calling user makes
client browser and SharePoint two hops apart. And by induction, they
may be any number of hops apart. This double-hop ability to pass along
a ticket representing the user is a distinguishing characteristic of
Kerberos (over NTLM), and requires only that any intermediary has an
SPN registered and its account enabled for delegation.</p>

<p>For obvious security reasons, an account isn't allowed to delegate
by default. To verify that delegation is indeed enabled for our
service app pool account, locate the account (user) within Windows
Active Directory Users and Groups. Under the user's Properties, on the
Delegation tab, ensure that either "Trust this user for delegation to
any service (Kerberos only)" or "Trust this user for delegation to
specified services only" is selected. The latter option, named
constrained delegation, is more secure in that any endpoint the
account wishes to delegate to must be explicitly listed.</p>

<h4>Domain names</h4>

<p>The syntactic resemblance between SPN and DNS host name is no
coincidence. Assuming that machine name and host name are different,
which in the real world they would typically be, Window Kerberos
requires the host name to be DNS resolvable. Not only that, but
an <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/gg502606.asp">SPN
must match a DNS A record</a>. Using DNS as a locator mechanism makes
sense given that on Windows, DNS is typically an integral part of the
domain controller, and the domain controller dynamically adds or
removes DNS records to govern the operation of Kerberos.</p>

<p>The A record requirement is by design of the Windows Kerberos
client library. Attempting to form an SPN with only a CNAME defined,
the client library fails to resolve the host name and with both a
CNAME and an A record (possibly pointing to different IP addresses),
the client uses the A record. Unable to form an SPN, the client cannot
query the TGT and authentication fails.</p>

<p>We can verify the existence of an A record using
the <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc725991.aspx">nslookup</a>
command.

<pre>
%&gt; nslookup -type=a &lt;my-server-1&gt;.&lt;domain&gt;.local

Server:   &lt;dns-host&gt;.&lt;domain&gt;.net
Address:  &lt;some-ip&gt;

Non-authoritative answer:
Name:     &lt;my-server-1&gt;.&lt;domain&gt;.local
Address:  &lt;some-other-ip&gt;
</pre>

<p>Here nslookup returned a single host, and assuming the IP address
does indeed point to our host, all our prerequisites are now
satisfied. Before continuing with the IIS and service setup, however,
a few additional limitations of Windows Kerberos client library and
Chrome are worth mentioning.</p>

<h4>Limitations of the Windows Kerberos client and Chrome</h4>

<p>Even though SPNs may optionally contain a port number, the Kerberos
client library used by .NET and Internet Explorer forms SPNs by way of
host names only. The client library is
<a href="http://www.sbrickey.com/Tech/Blog/Post/IE_and_Net_Framework_Feature_Request_Fix_support_for_Kerberos_for_non-default_ports">limited</a>
to requesting only two tickets per host name: one for the default HTTP
port and one for the default HTTPS port. Running services on any other
port, and with a different app pool account, isn't possible.</p>

<p>Another limitation encountered is Chrome defaulting to not allow
delegation. Presumably, Chrome forms an SPN and then queries Active
Directory to learn whether the account associated with the SPN has
delegation enabled. Otherwise how would Chrome infer that the service
it calls may transparently decide to delegate? With delegation
enabled, Chrome throws an HTTP 401 Unauthorized on calling the
service. Once aware of the issue, it's easily resolved
by <a href="http://dev.chromium.org/administrators/policy-list-3#AuthNegotiateDelegateWhitelis">explicitly
whitelisting</a> the service URL with Chrome and possibly rolling out
a registry change through Group Policy Objects.</p>

<h2>Setting up Internet Information Services</h2>

<p>Setting up a web app under a web site in IIS, a few common issues
may arise. First, because a new application inherits settings from its
parent, some web app settings below may already have their designated
values. Second, IIS reads and writes some IIS setting from and to an
application's web.config file. xcopy deploying an application to IIS,
and modifying the web app through the IIS Manager, may reset these
settings on either end. Thus, do double-check IIS and web.config
settings if Kerberos isn't working after following these steps:</p>

<ol>

<li><p>Create a new application and choose an existing app pool
running under the identity of the aforementioned
account. Alternatively, create a new app pool and adjust its identity
later.</p></li>

<li><p>For the new application, under Authentication, ensure that
Anonymous Authentication is disabled and that Windows Authentication
is enabled. As per the second IIS issue mentioned above, beware that
deploying a vanilla MVC/WebAPI app (with its minimal web.config)
causes Anonymous Authentication to become re-enabled (and
authentication to fail).</p>

<p>With Anonymous Authentication disabled, the client receives a 401
Unauthorized response from the service, indicating that authentication
is required. The response includes WWW-Authenticate headers to tell
the clients of the supported authentication protocols. It's up to the
client to resend the request, including adhering to one of the
supported protocols.</p>

<p>If the request is generated using the .NET
framework <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.net.webclient">WebClient</a>/<a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.net.webrequest">WebRequest</a>
classes, this exchange is hidden from the application because the
framework responds to the 401 Unauthorized on its own by choosing a
compatible authentication protocol and resubmitting the original
request with an extra Authorization header. The request does incur an
extra roundtrip, but that too can be avoided on subsequent requests if
the
<a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.net.webrequest.preauthenticate">PreAuthenticate</a>
property of the WebRequest class is set to true.</p>

<li>
<p>Select Windows Authentication, Advanced Settings..., and ensure
that <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd767318">Extended
Protection</a> is Off.<p>

<p>Somewhat simplified, when enabling Extended Protection for
authentication, i.e., setting the option to Accept or Required, it
enables a kind of two-factor authentication against man-in-the-middle
attacks, but only when the communication happens over a TLS channel,
such as HTTPS.</p>

<p>As part of
the <a href="http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1230000000545/ch04.html#TLS_HANDSHAKE">TLS
handshake</a> between two endpoints, a TLS session is generated. This
key is included as part of the encrypted Kerberos ticket if client and
server supports it, regardless of whether Extended Protection is
enabled. By enabling Extended Protection, IIS ensures that the actual
TLS session key is equal to the TLS session key in the Kerberos ticket
(in addition to ensuring that the regular Kerberos ticket session keys
match). If the TLS session keys don't match, an additional host must
exist between client and server.</p>

<p>Introducing a load balancer between client and service effectively
makes the load balancer the man-in-the-middle (albeit a friendly
one). One TLS connection exists between client and load balancer and
another between load balancer and service, each with a different TLS
session key, causing authentication to fail. In other words, Extended
Protection is for use only when no load balancer is involved.</p>

<li><p>Select Windows Authentication, Advanced Settings..., and ensure
that
<a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/gg502606.aspx">Kernel
Mode authentication</a> is disabled.</p>

<p>Kernel mode authentication makes
the <a href="http://www.iis.net/learn/get-started/introduction-to-iis/introduction-to-iis-architecture#Hypertext">http.sys</a>
kernel mode driver responsible for decrypting Kerberos tickets and
caching the decrypted tickets. By default, decryption can only succeed
when the host name and DNS A record for the service are the same or no
DNS entry is present.</p>

<p>In that case, decryption works because a Windows server joining a
Active Directory domain will automatically register an SPN with a
special machine account and machine name. Given that http.sys runs
under the machine credentials, it can decrypt the ticket only for that
machine name and credentials. With regular accounts, decryption
typically happens using a hash of an app pool account's password, but
for machine accounts the password is auto-generated.</p>

<p>By either disabling Kernel Mode Authentication,
or <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/library/dd573004">configuring
Kernel Mode Authentication to use app pool credentials</a>,
authentication works when a load balancer is involved. For low-traffic
web apps, disabling Kernel Mode Authentication is probably best.</p></li>

<li><p>Under <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_Support_Provider_Interface">Providers</a>, ensure the order is Negotiate followed by
NTLM. That way authentication
<a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms789031">selects
between Kerberos and NTLM</a> and in that order, depending on what's
available with the client. Strictly speaking, NTLM is now included
twice, but as part of different providers. NTLM, by the way, is still
both valid and usable in single-hop scenarios.</p></li>

</ol>

<p>Installing <a href="http://www.iis.net/downloads/community/2009/06/delegconfig-v2-beta-delegation-kerberos-configuration-tool">DelegConfig</a>,
our test web app/service, into our newly created web app allows for
end-to-end validation of Kerberos authentication with delegation. What
DelegConfig can do is issue an HTTP GET request to a URL of our
choosing while passing along a Kerberos ticket. The response is
displayed inside the app. With DelegConfig's Test.aspx page, we can
issue a request to SharePoint, asking for details on the currently
logged in user (via
https://server/path-to-web/_api/Web/CurrentUser). If all goes well,
the page should display information about the user accessing
DelegConfig accessing SharePoint.</p>

<h4>Conclusion</h4>

<p>In this post, we detailed the typical issues that one encounter
with getting Kerberos authentication with delegation up and
running. These issues likely cover most cases of working with
Kerberos. When Kerberos fails to work, however, besides testing with
DelegConfig, make sure to always clear the Kerberos tickets cache
using
the <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh134826">klist</a>
command. <a href="https://www.telerik.com/download/fiddler">Fiddler</a>
and <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/psping.aspx">psping</a>
come in handy to inspect the request/response headers and HTTP status
codes and making sure any port used by Kerberos and the service are
open. Lastly, for lower-level debugging of Kerberos,
<a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc738673">registry
tweaks to increase the Kerberos log level</a> are possible, perhaps in
combination with <a href="https://www.wireshark.org/">Wireshark</a> to
inspect actual messages.</p>
