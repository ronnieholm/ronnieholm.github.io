Part 3: Making outbound requests from an ASP.NET MVC/WebAPI application using Kerberos delegated credentials</a>
</p>

<p>This post summarizes the lessons learned setting up an Internet
Information Services (IIS) web application using Kerberos
authentication (see introduction <a href="http://www.roguelynn.com
/words/explain-like-im-5-kerberos">here</a>
and <a href="https://web.mit.edu/kerberos/dialogue.html">here</a>)
with <a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/autz_auth_stuff/2011/05/03/kerberos-delegation">delegation</a>.
Following the verification of prerequisites for Kerberos and IIS, a
test web service (a web application) is installed. Its task is to
verify end to end authentication by accepting requests from clients
and making requests to a Kerberos-enabled SharePoint instance on
behalf of those clients.</p>

<p>In terms of flow, communication from the client, such as from a
browser, to SharePoint and back is illustrated below. Included in the
diagram are optional load balancers sitting between the client and web
service and between the web service and the Kerberos-enabled,
on-premise SharePoint 2013 used for testing and illustration
purposes:</p>

<pre>
Client <-> (Load balancer) <-> Web service <-> (Load balancer) <-> SharePoint
</pre

<p>In addition to a client calling into SharePoint directly using the
client's own credentials, the flow enables a client to make indirect
calls through the service and have the service switch between
executing using the client's credentials or those of a more privileged
account. The service can then carry out privileged operations, such as
creating a site collection, while otherwise execute code using the
client's credentials, and be subject to SharePoint's build-in
authorization checks. Only while executing using privileged
credentials are custom authorization checks needed.</p>

<h2>Verifying prerequisites</h2>

<p>Before getting to the IIS part, let's first verify that Active
Directory and Kerberos with delegation have been properly configured
by a domain administrator.</p>

<h4>Service Principal Names</h4>

<p>With <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc772815">Windows
Kerberos</a>, the Key Distribution Center (KDC), Authentication Server
(AS), and Ticket Granting Server (TGS) are integral parts of the
domain controller. We therefore register a one-to-many binding with
the domain controller, relating the web service's app pool account to
endpoints. In Kerberos terms, we register a Service Principal Name
(SPN) for an account. Think of a principal as the general term for a
user, computer, or service. An SPN is then a unique identifier for a
service running on a server, and is used by a client to locate a
service.</p>

<p>Looking up, or forming, a service principal by name (for an
endpoint) is what enables a client to request credentials from the
TGS, valid for the particular service only. As part of the credentials
received is a ticket encrypted by TGS for the client to pass to the
service. Only the service is capable of decrypting this ticket,
thereby validating the identity of the client from what the ticket
contains. With the decrypted ticket in hand, and using an encryption
key from inside the ticket, the service then sends back an encrypted
message to the client that only it can decrypt, thereby validating the
server's identity.</p>

<p>By both client and server trusting a common third-party (KDC, AS,
TGS), this Kerberos handshake establishes mutual trust between two
principals over an unsecured network. From then on, the parties may
continue to exchange encrypted messages using Kerberos encryption keys
or, more likely, the connection is already protected by Transport
Layer Security.</p>

<p>The existence of an SPN for an app pool account is easily verified
with the
<a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc731241.aspx">setspn</a>
command which, despite its name, is used for
both <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/sv-se/library/cc755413">setting
and querying principals</a>. While a domain administrator must have
made a prior call to setspn to create the principal, any computer
within the domain can query principals:</p>

<pre>
%&gt; setspn &lt;domain&gt;\&lt;app-pool-account&gt;
Registered ServicePrincipalNames for CN=&lt;app-pool-account&gt;,OU=AD,OU=ServiceAccounts,OU=AcmeCorp,DC=&lt;domain&gt;,DC=local:
    HTTP/&lt;my-server-1&gt;.&lt;domain&gt;.local
    HTTP/&lt;my-server-1&gt;
    HTTP/&lt;my-server-2&gt;.&lt;domain&gt;.local
    HTTP/&lt;my-server-2&gt;
</pre>

<p>The output reveals that four SPNs are associated with the app pool
account. It's common for an endpoint to have two registered principals
matching DNS host name and NetBIOS name, respectively. In other words,
our service could be deployed to either or both servers listed
above.</p>

<h4>Delegation</h4>

<p>Let's move on and verify the app pool account's ability to not only
receive and process, but also delegate, Kerberos tickets, i.e., call
another service on the client's behalf.</p>

<p>With an intermediary service acting on behalf of a client, the
client and SharePoint are now two hops apart (and by induction, any
number of hops apart). Passing along the ticket, and having it remain
valid for any intermediary to use for impersonation against the next
service, is a distinguishing characteristic of Kerberos over NTLM. It
requires only that any intermediary has an SPN registered and that its
account is enabled for delegation.</p>

<p>For obvious security reasons, by default an account isn't allowed
to transparently delegate client credentials. To verify that
delegation is indeed enabled for our service's app pool account,
locate the account (user) within Windows Active Directory Users and
Groups. Under the user's Properties, on the Delegation tab, ensure
that either "Trust this user for delegation to any service (Kerberos
only)" or "Trust this user for delegation to specified services only"
is selected. The latter option, also named constrained delegation, is
considered more secure in that any endpoint the account wishes to
delegate to must be explicitly listed.</p>

<h4>Domain names</h4>

<p>The syntactic resemblance between an SPN and a DNS host name is no
coincidence. Assuming that machine name and host name are different,
which in the real world they typically are, Window Kerberos requires
an <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/gg502606.asp">SPN
to be matched by a DNS A record</a> (and not a CNAME). Using DNS as a
locator mechanism makes sense given that the DNS service is typically
an integral part of a domain controller, and given that the domain
controller dynamically adds and removes DNS records for Kerberos to
operate smoothly.</p>

<p>The A record requirement is by design of the Windows Kerberos
client library. Attempting to form an SPN with only a CNAME defined,
the client library fails to resolve the host name and with both a
CNAME and an A record (possibly pointing to different IP addresses),
the client will use the A record. Unable to form an SPN, the client
isn't able to query the TGS and authentication will fail.</p>

<p>We can verify the existence of an A record using
the <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc725991.aspx">nslookup</a>
command.

<pre>
%&gt; nslookup -type=a &lt;my-server-1&gt;.&lt;domain&gt;.local

Server:   &lt;dns-host&gt;.&lt;domain&gt;.net
Address:  &lt;some-ip&gt;

Non-authoritative answer:
Name:     &lt;my-server-1&gt;.&lt;domain&gt;.local
Address:  &lt;some-other-ip&gt;
</pre>

<p>Here nslookup returned a single host, and assuming the IP address
does indeed point to our host, our Kerberos prerequisites are now
satisfied. Before continuing with the IIS and test service setup,
however, a few additional limitations of the Windows Kerberos client
library and Chrome are worth mentioning.</p>

<h4>Limitations of the Windows Kerberos client and Chrome</h4>

<p>Even though SPNs may optionally contain a port number, the Kerberos
client library used by .NET and Internet Explorer forms SPNs by way of
host names only. The client library is
<a href="http://www.sbrickey.com/Tech/Blog/Post/IE_and_Net_Framework_Feature_Request_Fix_support_for_Kerberos_for_non-default_ports">limited</a>
to request only two tickets per host name: one for the default HTTP
port and one for the default HTTPS port. Running services on any other
port, and with a different app pool account, isn't supported.</p>

<p>Chrome on the other hand comes with its own cross-platform Kerberos
client library with support for SPNs registered with any port. Also,
Chrome supports both CNAME and A record DNS entries matching SPNs.</p>

<p>A limitation of Chrome is that by default it doesn't allow calling
a service which may delegate credentials. The service's URL must be
<a href="http://dev.chromium.org/administrators/policy-list-3#AuthNegotiateDelegateWhitelis">explicitly
whitelisted</a> by modifying the registry (or via an update to Group
Policy Objects) or an HTTP 401 Unauthorized results when calling the
service. Behind the scenes, the whitelist affects how Chrome sets up
its Windows security context. This context is responsible for actually
passing the Kerberos ticket, including other security related
parameters, to the service. Even if the Kerberos ticket has its
delegation flag set, the context has its own delegation flag which
takes precedence. It's the setting of this flag that's controlled by
the whitelist. Similarly, a service creates a security context to read
the Kerberos ticket and related security parameters. It's a mismatch
between these parameters that causes the HTTP 401.</p>

<h2>Setting up Internet Information Services</h2>

<p>Setting up a new web application under a web site in IIS, a few
common issues may arise. First, because a new application inherits
settings from its parent web site, some of the settings below may
already have their designated values. Second, because IIS reads and
writes some setting from and to a web.config file, beware that xcopy
deploying an application to IIS, or modifying settings through the IIS
Manager, may reset settings in the other. Thus, if Kerberos isn't
working after following the steps below, then check IIS and web.config
settings:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Create a new web application and choose an existing app pool
running under the identity of the aforementioned account. As an
alternative, create a new app pool and adjust its identity.</p></li>

<li><p>For the new web application, under Authentication, ensure that
Anonymous Authentication is disabled and that Windows Authentication
is enabled. As per the second IIS issue mentioned above, beware that
deploying a vanilla MVC/WebAPI app (with its minimal web.config)
causes Anonymous Authentication to become re-enabled and future
authentication to fail.</p>

<p>With Anonymous Authentication disabled, the client receives a 401
Unauthorized response from the service, indicating that authentication
is required. The response includes WWW-Authenticate headers to inform
client of supported authentication protocols. It's up to the client to
resend the request and adhere to one of the authentication
protocols.</p>

<p>If the request is generated using the .NET
framework <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.net.webclient">WebClient</a>/<a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.net.webrequest">WebRequest</a>
classes, this exchange is hidden from the application. The framework
responds to the 401 Unauthorized on its own by choosing a compatible
authentication protocol and resubmitting the original request with the
extra Authorization header. The request does incur an extra roundtrip,
but that too can be avoided on subsequent requests by setting the
<a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.net.webrequest.preauthenticate">PreAuthenticate</a>
property of the WebRequest class to true.</p>

<li>
<p>Select Windows Authentication, Advanced Settings..., and ensure
that <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd767318">Extended
Protection</a> is Off.<p>

<p>Somewhat simplified, when enabling Extended Protection for
authentication, i.e., setting the option to Accept or Required, a kind
of two-factor authentication against man-in-the-middle attacks is
enabled, but only when communication happens over a TLS channel, such
as over HTTPS.</p>

<p>As part of
the <a href="http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1230000000545/ch04.html#TLS_HANDSHAKE">TLS
handshake</a> between two endpoints, a TLS session key is
generated. This key is included as part of the encrypted Kerberos
ticket if client and server supports it, regardless of whether
Extended Protection is enabled. By enabling Extended Protection, IIS
ensures that the actual TLS session key is equal to the TLS session
key in the Kerberos ticket. If the TLS session keys don't match, an
intermediate host must exist between client and server.</p>

<p>Introducing a load balancer between client and service effectively
makes the load balancer a man-in-the-middle (albeit a friendly
one). One TLS connection exists between client and load balancer and
another between load balancer and service. Each connection has a
different TLS session key, causing authentication to fail if Extended
Protection is enabled. In other words, Extended Protection is for use
only when no load balancer is involved.</p>

<li><p>Select Windows Authentication, Advanced Settings..., and ensure
that
<a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/gg502606.aspx">Kernel
Mode authentication</a> is disabled.</p>

<p>Kernel Mode Authentication makes
the <a href="http://www.iis.net/learn/get-started/introduction-to-iis/introduction-to-iis-architecture#Hypertext">http.sys</a>
kernel mode driver responsible for decrypting and caching Kerberos
tickets. With Kernel mode authentication, by default decryption can
only succeed when the host name and DNS A record for the service are
the same or if no DNS entry is present.</p>

<p>In that case, decryption works because a Windows server joining a
Active Directory domain will automatically register an SPN with a
special machine account and machine name. Given that http.sys runs
under machine credentials, it can decrypt the ticket for that machine
name using the machine credentials. In comparison, with regular
accounts, decryption typically happens using a hash of the app pool
account's password.</p>

<p>By either disabling Kernel Mode Authentication,
or <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/library/dd573004">configuring
Kernel Mode Authentication to use app pool credentials</a>,
authentication works when a load balancer is involved. For low-traffic
web apps, disabling Kernel Mode Authentication is probably the
simplest and will have negligible performance impact.</p></li>

<li><p>Under <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_Support_Provider_Interface">Providers</a>, ensure the order is Negotiate followed by
NTLM. That way authentication
<a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms789031">selects
between Kerberos and NTLM</a> and in that order, depending on what's
available with the client. Strictly speaking, NTLM is now included
twice, but as part of different providers. NTLM by the way is still
both valid and usable in single-hop scenarios.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>By installing into our newly created web application
the <a href="http://www.iis.net/downloads/community/2009/06/delegconfig-v2-beta-delegation-kerberos-configuration-tool">DelegConfig</a>
test service, end to end validation of Kerberos authentication with
delegation is now possible. What DelegConfig offers is a way to issue
HTTP GET requests to a URL of our choosing while passing along the
client's Kerberos ticket and displaying the response. On the Test.aspx
page, we can issue a request to SharePoint, asking for details on the
currently logged in user (via
https://server/path-to-web/_api/Web/CurrentUser). If Kerberos with
delegation is correctly configured, the page should display
information about the user accessing DelegConfig accessing
SharePoint.</p>

<h4>Conclusion</h4>

<p>In this post, we detailed the typical issues that one encounter
with getting Kerberos authentication with delegation up and
running. If Kerberos fails to work, however, besides testing with
DelegConfig, make sure to always clear the Kerberos tickets cache
using
the <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh134826">klist</a>
command. In addition,
 <a href="https://www.telerik.com/download/fiddler">Fiddler</a>
and <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/psping.aspx">psping</a>
come in handy to view the request/response headers and HTTP status
codes and for ensuring unrestricted access to any host and port
required by Kerberos and the service. For lower-level debugging of
Kerberos, browsing the server's Event Viewer, under Windows Logs,
Security, possibly in combination
with <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc738673">registry
tweaks to increase the Kerberos log level</a> and
running <a href="https://www.wireshark.org/">Wireshark</a> to capture
traffic on the wire is invaluable. Another handy resource for
debugging
is <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=23176">configuring
Kerberos authentication for SharePoint 2010 products</a>. Many of the
considerations listed in the document are equally applicable outside
SharePoint.</p>
