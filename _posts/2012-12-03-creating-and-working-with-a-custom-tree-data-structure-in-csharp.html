  <p>I'd claim the tree data structure is underused in general application development. Sure, XML or tree view control APIs are generally tree-based underneath, but how often does an application use a tree structure in its business layer? Maybe it's because trees are initially a little hard to grasp given their recursive nature or maybe it's because we as developers are conditioned to approach problems from a more imperative angle.</p>
  <p>It wasn't until recently, when I had to transform a tabular data structure into a tree data structure, that I created my own tree in C#. Here's the code I ended up with for constructing a tree, doing a depth-first search for a node, and printing the tree:</p>
  <pre class="prettyprint lang-cs">
public class Tree&lt;T&gt; {
    public T Value;
    public IList&lt;Tree&lt;T&gt;&gt; Children;

    public Tree(T value) {
        Value = value;
        Children = new List&lt;Tree&lt;T&gt;&gt;();
    }

    public Tree&lt;T&gt; Find(Func&lt;T, bool&gt; predicate) {
        if (predicate(Value))
            return this;
           
        return Children
            .Select(c =&gt; c.Find(predicate))
            .FirstOrDefault(c =&gt; c != null);
    }

    public override string ToString() {
        return ToStringRecursive(this, 0);
    }

    private string ToStringRecursive(Tree&lt;T&gt; tree, int indentation) {
        var seed = (new String(' ', indentation)) + tree.Value + Environment.NewLine;
        return tree
            .Children
            .Aggregate(seed, (current, next) =&gt; current + 
                ToStringRecursive(next, indentation + 2));
    }
}</pre>
  <p>Constructing a tree of strings is done as follows:</p>
  <pre class="prettyprint lang-cs">
var root = new Tree&lt;string&gt;(&quot;root&quot;) {
    Children = new List&lt;Tree&lt;string&gt;&gt; {
        new Tree&lt;string&gt;(&quot;node-1&quot;) {
            Children = new List&lt;Tree&lt;string&gt;&gt; {
                new Tree&lt;string&gt;(&quot;node-1.1&quot;) {
                    Children = new List&lt;Tree&lt;string&gt;&gt; {
                        new Tree&lt;string&gt;(&quot;node-1.1.1&quot;)  
                    }
                },
                new Tree&lt;string&gt;(&quot;node-1.2&quot;)
            }
        },
        new Tree&lt;string&gt;(&quot;node-2&quot;)
    }
};</pre>
  <p>Now you can query on the properties of the type of tree node:</p>
  <pre class="prettyprint lang-cs">
System.Console.WriteLine(root);
/*
root
  node-1
    node-1.1
      node-1.1.1
    node-1.2
  node-2
*/

var node1 = root.Find(n =&gt; n == &quot;node-1&quot;);
var node2 = node1.Find(n =&gt; n == &quot;node-1.1.1&quot;);

System.Console.WriteLine(node1);
/*
node-1
  node-1.1
    node-1.1.1
  node-1.2
*/

System.Console.WriteLine(node2);
/*
node-1.1.1            
*/</pre>
  <p>Strictly speaking, the traversal logic doesn't belong to the tree class itself, but in a separate visitor class. Maybe at a later point, you want to add different traversal algorithms or some other code needs to iterate the tree to transform it. The visitor algorithms could be reused, calling out to a delegate for the details of the traversal.</p>
