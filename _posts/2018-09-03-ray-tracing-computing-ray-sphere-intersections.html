    Part 2: Ray tracing: Computing ray-sphere intersections
  </p> 
  
  <p>
    Whereas
    the <a href="/blog/2018/09/01/ray-tracing-computing-ray-circle-intersections">previous</a>
    post was about 2D ray-circle intersections, this one is about 3D
    ray-sphere intersections. We'll extend the circle standard
    equation to a sphere, and switch from scalars to vectors for
    defining both line and sphere. With vectors, we can generalize and
    perform intersection calculations for any dimension in a succinct
    manner.
  </p>

  <h3>Sphere offset from origin</h3>
  <p>
    Except for the added third dimension, the equation of a sphere
    centered at a position \(c\) is identical to that of the
    circle. Its equation still follows from
    the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagorean_theorem">Pythagorean
    theorem</a>:

    $$(x - c_x)^2 + (y - c_y)^2 + (z - c_z)^2 = r^2$$

    With the sphere centered at origin \((0,0,0)\), the \(c\) terms
    disappear and the equation becomes

    $$x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = r^2$$
  </p>

  <h3>Vector standard form of a line</h3>
  <p>
    The \(y = ax + b\) definition of a line in 2D doesn't generalize
    to 3D. In 2D the line equation expresses that a change in one
    dimension may cause a change in at most one other dimension. In
    3D, however, a change in one dimension may cause a change in two
    other dimensions.
  </p>
  <p>
    Instead, a line in 3D is expressed as a starting position \(p_0\)
    and an amount of movement \(t\) in some direction
    \(p_1\). Statements about position and direction are best
    expressed in terms of vectors and operations on vectors:

    $$\vec p = \vec{p_0} + t\vec{p_1}$$

    Different values of \(t\), for time, result in a line described by
    a fixed origin and a position vector pointing at different points
    on the line (we consider a position vector and a point
    synonymous). Different values of \(t\) has the effect of scaling
    the position vector along the line, allowing us to get to any
    position on the line.
  </p>
  <p>
    In ray tracing we're only interested in the half-line where \(t >
    0\). That half-line represents a ray traveling from the camera
    into the scene, and that's why we refer to it as a ray instead of
    a line. \(t = 0\) would be the position of the camera and \(t <
    0\) a ray traveling out back of the camera.
  </p>
  <p>
    As an example, we can find the parametric equation of the line
    passing through \((1,-1,4)\), the position of the camera, in the
    direction of \((3,5,-1)\), a scene object. We do so by
    substituting the two vectors into the vector equation for a line:

    $$\begin{eqnarray*}
    \vec p = (1,-1,4) + t(3,5,-2)\\
    \vec p = (1,-1,4) + (3t,5t,-2t)\\
    (x,y,z) = (1+3t,-1+5t,4-2t)
    \end{eqnarray*}$$
    
    For ray-sphere intersections, we're after values of \(t\)
    describing points of intersection. Once we have those values, we
    can substitute those into the parametric equation of a line to get
    the \((x,y,z)\) coordinate of intersections.
  </p>
  
  <h3>Line and sphere intersections, scalar edition</h3>
  <p>
    As an example, suppose we have the parametric equation of a line
    \((10 + 2t, 5 + t, 2)\) and the equation of a sphere \(x^2 + y^2 +
    z^2 = 9\) on standard form. As with 2D intersections, we're after
    values for \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\) that when substituted into both
    equations make those equations equal. We can put in what we know
    about the unknowns of one equation into the other:

    $$\begin{eqnarray*}
    (10 + 2t)^2 + (5 + t)^2 + (2)^2 = 9 & & \textrm{\{substitute in line equation\}}\\
    (10 + 2t)(10 + 2t) + (5 + t)(5 + t) + 4 = 9 & & \textrm{\{expand squares\}}\\
    100 + 20t + 20t + 4t^2 + 25 + 5t + 5t + t^2 + 4 = 9 & & \textrm{\{expand parenthesis\}}\\
    5t^2 + 50t + 129 = 9 & & \textrm{\{simplify and arrange in \(t^2\), \(t\), and constants order\}}\\
    5t^2 + 50t + 120 = 0 & & \textrm{\{move 9 to left side to arrive at the standard form of quadratic equation\}}
    \end{eqnarray*}$$

    We went from one sphere equation with three unknowns, \(x\),
    \(y\), and \(z\), and ended up with a quadratic equation with one
    unknown \(t\). Solving for \(t\) means applying the same method
    as <a href="/blog/2018/09/01/ray-tracing-computing-ray-circle-intersections">previous</a>:

    $$\begin{eqnarray*}
    t = \dfrac{-b \pm \sqrt{d}}{2a} \textrm{, where \(d = b^2 - 4ac\)}\\
    d = 50 - 4(5)(120) = 100\\
    t_1 = \dfrac{-50 + \sqrt{100}}{2(5)} = \dfrac{-50 + 10}{10} = \dfrac{-40}{10} = -4\\
    t_2 = \dfrac{-50 - \sqrt{100}}{2(5)} = \dfrac{-50 - 10}{10} = \dfrac{-60}{10} = -6\\
    \end{eqnarray*}$$     

    Substituting these \(t\) values into the parametric vector
    equation of the line, we arrive at the points of line-sphere
    intersection:

    $$\begin{eqnarray*}
    \vec{p_1} = (x_1,y_1,z_1) = (10 + 2(-4), 5 + (-4), 2) = (2,1,2)\\
    \vec{p_2} = (x_2,y_2,z_2) = (10 + 2(-6), 5 + (-6), 2) = (-2,-1,2)
    \end{eqnarray*}$$

  </p>

  <h3>Line and sphere intersections, vector edition</h3>
  <p>
    Above we established the standard vector equation for a line. For
    a sphere centered at \(c\) with radius \(r\), its corresponding
    standard vector equation is as below. In a moment, we'll show why
    that's the case:

    $$(\vec p - \vec c) \cdot (\vec p - \vec c) = r^2$$

    \(\vec p\) represents every position vector on the sphere and
    \(\cdot\) is
    the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_product">dot
    product</a> of two vectors. The term product in general refers to
    the result of multiplication, but unlike the single product
    definition for scalars, vectors have both dot product and cross
    product. We're only interested in the dot product, defined as the
    sum of the products of the corresponding entries, making the
    result a scalar, not another vector.
  </p>
  <p>
    In the following equations, whether scalar product or dot product
    is meant can always be inferred based on whether both operands are
    scalars or both are vectors. Strictly speaking, we don't need the
    \(\cdot\) symbol, but it's convention.
  </p>
  <p>
    At first sight, the standard vector equation of a sphere looks
    nothing like its scalar counterpart. But note the dot product's
    definition:

    $$\vec u \cdot \vec v = {u_x}{v_x} + {u_y}{v_y} + {u_z}{v_z} = r^2$$    

    If \(\vec{u} = \vec{v}\), as is the case for the vector sphere
    definition, expanding the dot product turns it into the scalar
    standard equation of a sphere. So while at first sight the dot
    product and sphere seem unrelated, defining the sphere in terms of
    the dot product is a handy shortcut:

    $$\vec u \cdot \vec u = {u_x}{u_x} + {u_y}{u_y} + {u_z}{u_z} =
    u_{x}^2 + u_{y}^2 + u_{z}^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = r^2$$
    
    As with the scalar solution to computing intersections, where we
    substituted the line equation into the circle equation, we can
    replace \(\vec p\) in the sphere equation by the vector equation
    of the line (don't be confused by the use of \(\vec p\) in both
    definitions. Those are different \(\vec p\)s):

    $$(\vec{p_0} + \vec{p_1}t - \vec c) \cdot (\vec{p_0} + \vec{p_1}t - \vec c) - r^2 = 0$$

    Through rewriting and simplification, the goal is to turn this
    complicated looking equation into a quadratic one and solve for
    \(t\). For an actual line and sphere, \(\vec{p_0}\),
    \(\vec{p_1}\), \(\vec c\), and \(r\) are known quantities, leaving
    \(t\) as the only unknown:
  </p>
  <p>
    $$\begin{eqnarray*}
    (\vec{p_0} \cdot \vec{p_0} + \vec{p_0} \cdot \vec{p_1}t - \vec{p_0} \cdot \vec c) + (\vec{p_1}t \cdot \vec{p_0} + \vec{p_1}t \cdot \vec{p_1}t - \vec{p_1}t \cdot \vec c) + (-\vec c \cdot \vec{p_0} - \vec c \cdot \vec{p_1}t + \vec c \cdot \vec c) - r^2 = 0 & & \textrm{\{expand dot product into 3 * 3 + 1 terms\}}\\

    \vec{p_0} \cdot \vec{p_0} + \vec{p_0} \cdot \vec{p_1}t - \vec{p_0} \cdot \vec c + \vec{p_1}t \cdot \vec{p_0} + \vec{p_1}t \cdot \vec{p_1}t - \vec{p_1}t \cdot \vec c - \vec c \cdot \vec{p_0} - \vec c \cdot \vec{p_1}t + \vec c \cdot \vec c - r^2 = 0 & & \textrm{\{remove parenthesis included as a visual aid\}}\\
    
    \vec{p_0} \cdot \vec{p_0} + \vec{p_0} \cdot \vec{p_1}t - \vec{p_0} \cdot \vec c + \vec{p_1}t \cdot \vec{p_0} + t^2(\vec{p_1} \cdot \vec{p_1}) - \vec{p_1}t \cdot \vec c - \vec c \cdot \vec{p_0} - \vec c \cdot \vec{p_1}t + \vec c \cdot \vec c - r^2 = 0 & & \textrm{\{factor out \(t\) in term where it appears twice\}}\\

    t^2(\vec{p_1} \cdot \vec{p_1}) + t(\vec{p_0} \cdot \vec{p_1} + \vec{p_1} \cdot \vec{p_0} - \vec{p_1} \cdot \vec c - \vec c \cdot \vec{p_1}) + \vec{p_0} \cdot \vec{p_0} - \vec{p_0} \cdot \vec c - \vec c \cdot \vec{p_0} + \vec c \cdot \vec c - r^2 = 0 & & \textrm{\{factor out \(t\) in terms where it appears once\}}\\

    t^2(\vec{p_1} \cdot \vec{p_1}) + t\vec{p_1}(\vec{p_0} + \vec{p_0} - \vec c - \vec c) + \vec{p_0} \cdot \vec{p_0} - \vec{p_0} \cdot \vec c - \vec c \cdot \vec{p_0} + \vec c \cdot \vec c - r^2 = 0 & & \textrm{\{factor out common \(\vec{p_1}\) in \(t(...)\) part\}}\\    

    t^2(\vec{p_1} \cdot \vec{p_1}) + t\vec{p_1}(2\vec{p_0} - 2\vec c) + \vec{p_0} \cdot \vec{p_0} - \vec{p_0} \cdot \vec c - \vec c \cdot \vec{p_0} + \vec c \cdot \vec c - r^2 = 0 & & \textrm{\{group similar element inside \(t(...)\) part\}}\\    
    
    t^2(\vec{p_1} \cdot \vec{p_1}) + 2t \vec{p_1} \cdot (\vec{p_0} - \vec c) + \vec{p_0} \cdot \vec{p_0} - \vec{p_0} \cdot \vec c - \vec c \cdot \vec{p_0} + \vec c \cdot \vec c - r^2 = 0 & & \textrm{\{apply distributive law inside \(t(...)\) part: \(ab - ac = a(b - c)\) and remove extra parenthesis\}}\\    
    
    t^2(\vec{p_1} \cdot \vec{p_1}) + 2t \vec{p_1} \cdot (\vec{p_0} - \vec c) + \vec{p_0}^2 + \vec{c}^2 - 2\vec{p_0} \cdot \vec{c} - r^2 = 0 & & \textrm{\{group similar elements in constants part\}}\\
    
    t^2(\vec{p_1} \cdot \vec{p_1}) + 2t \vec{p_1} \cdot (\vec{p_0} - \vec c) + (\vec{p_0} + \vec c)^2 - r^2 = 0 & & \textrm{\{apply binomial square law to constants part: \(a^2 + b^2 - 2ab = (a - b)^2\)\}}\\       
    \end{eqnarray*}$$     

    Or in terms of the standard form of a quadratic equation: \(at^2 +
    bt + c\), from above we get

    \begin{eqnarray*}
    a = \vec{p_1} \cdot \vec{p_1}\\
    b = 2\vec{p_1} \cdot (\vec{p_0} - \vec c)\\
    c = (\vec{p_0} + \vec c)^2 - r^2
    \end{eqnarray*}
    
    Because the dot product of two vectors results in a scalar, once
    we substitute in the known elements (\(\vec{p_0}\), \(\vec{p_1}\),
    \(\vec c\), and \(r\)) and simplify, we're left with a quadratic
    equation.
  </p>
  <p>
    Continuing with the example from above in which we have
    \(\vec{p_0} = (10,5,2)\), \(\vec{p_1} = (2,1,0)\), \(\vec c =
    (0,0,0)\), and \(r^2 = 9\):

    $$\begin{eqnarray*}
    t^2((2,1,0) \cdot (2,1,0)) + 2t(2,1,0) \cdot ((10,5,2)-(0,0,0)) + ((10,5,2) + (0,0,0) \cdot ((10,5,2) - (0,0,0)) - 3^2 = 0\\
    t^2(5) + 2t(2,1,0) \cdot (10,5,2) + ((10,5,2) \cdot (10,5,2)) - 9 = 0\\
    t^2(5) + 2t(2,1,0) \cdot (10,5,2) + (129) - 9 = 0\\
    t^2(5) + 2t(25) + 120 = 0\\
    t^2(5) + t(50) + 120 = 0\\
    5t^2 + 50t + 120 = 0
    \end{eqnarray*}$$

    which shows that the scalar and vector editions yield identical
    results.

    Carrying out the simplification steps requires the memorization of
    rules. Or having a site such as

    simplification.

  <h3>Efficiently solving the quadratic equation on a computer</h3>
  <p>
    While the quadratic equation with \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) above is
    mathematically correct, it can be further optimized for execution
    speed. For one, the \(\vec{p_0} - \vec c\) expression is computed
    twice: once for \(b\) and once for \(c\). Extracting it into
    \(\mathrm{oc}\) for distance between origin and center:

    \begin{eqnarray*}
    \mathrm{\vec{oc}} = \vec{p_0} - \vec c\\
    a = \vec{p_1} \cdot \vec{p_1}\\
    b = 2\vec{p_1} \cdot \mathrm{\vec{oc}}\\
    c = (\vec{\mathrm{oc}})^2 - r^2
    \end{eqnarray*}    
  </p>
  <p>Another more elaborate optimization involves getting rid of
    coefficients during the computation of roots, saving three
    multiplication operations for each root computation. We start by
    defining \(d\), not to be confused by the discriminator as

    $$\begin{eqnarray*}
    d = \vec{p_1} \cdot \mathrm{\vec{oc}}
    \end{eqnarray*}$$
    
    From the definition of \(b\) it follows that \(b = 2d\).

    $$\begin{eqnarray*}
    \dfrac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} & & \textrm{\{Substitute \(b\) with \(2d\)}\}\\
    \dfrac{-2d \pm \sqrt{(2d)^2 - 4ac}}{2a} & & \textrm{\{Apply exponential rule: \((a \cdot b)^n = a^{n}b^n\)}\}\\
    \dfrac{-2d \pm \sqrt{4d^2 - 4ac}}{2a} & & \textrm{\{Factor out common term 4}\}\\
    \dfrac{-2d \pm \sqrt{4(d^2 - ac)}}{2a} & & \textrm{\{Apply radical rule: \(\sqrt[\uproot{3}n]{ab} = \sqrt[\uproot{3}n]{a} \sqrt[\uproot{3}n]{b}\), assuming \(a \geq 0\), \(b \geq 0\)}\}\\
    \dfrac{-2d \pm 2\sqrt{d^2 - ac}}{2a} & & \textrm{\{Factor out common term \(2\)}\}\\
    \dfrac{2(-d \pm \sqrt{d^2 - ac)}}{2a} & & \textrm{\{Divide the numbers: \(\frac{2}{2} = 1\)}\}\\
    \dfrac{-d \pm \sqrt{d^2 - ac}}{a} & & \textrm{}\\
    \end{eqnarray*}$$

    The result is a new formula for computing roots specific to \(a\),
    \(b\), \(c\) as derived for ray-sphere intersection. In summary,
    here're the final definitions for use in code:

    \begin{eqnarray*}
    \mathrm{\vec{oc}} = \vec{p_0} - \vec c\\
    a = \vec{p_1} \cdot \vec{p_1}\\
    b = \vec{p_1} \cdot \mathrm{\vec{oc}}\\
    c = (\vec{\mathrm{oc}})^2 - r^2\\
    \textrm{discriminator} = b^2 - ac
    \end{eqnarray*}

  <h3>Summary</h3>
  <p>
    In computer graphics, we almost always want equations expressed in
    terms of vectors. This gives us the ability to treat the \(x\),
    \(y\), and \(z\) components of a vector as a single unit, making
    equations shorter and clearer. Similarly, defining and applying
    vector operations in code make it shorter and less
    error-phone. Like in object oriented programming when we create a
    class to group related data and operations.
  </p>
  <p>
    Having now derived the ray-sphere intersection equation, we have
    the mathematics in place to create a first ray tracer; one that
    shoots rays from the camera, through each pixel, and into the
    scene where it potentially intersects with a sphere. That'll be
    the subject of the next post.
