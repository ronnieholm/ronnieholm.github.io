<div id="post">  
  <p>
    Whereas
    the <a href="/blog/2018/09/01/ray-tracing-computing-ray-circle-intersections">previous</a>
    post was about ray-circle intersections with scalars, this one is
    about ray-sphere intersections with vectors. We'll extend the
    circle standard equation to a sphere, and switch to vector
    notation for defining both sphere and line. Using vectors, we can
    generalize and perform intersection calculations succinctly for
    any dimension. In a sense, vectors hide details about its scalar
    components, letting us operate on the vector as a whole.
  </p>

  <h4>Sphere offset from origin</h4>
  <p>
    Except for the added dimension, the equation of a sphere centered
    at a point \(c\) is identical to that of the circle. Its equation
    still follows from the Pythagorean theorem:

    $$(x - c_x)^2 + (y - c_y)^2 + (z - c_z)^2 = r^2$$

    If the sphere is centered at the origin the \(c\) terms go away
    and the equation becomes

    $$x^2 + b^2 + c^2 = r^2$$
  </p>

  <h4>Vector standard form of a line</h4>
  <p>
    Defining a line in 3D isn't as straightforward as in 2D. We don't
    something similar to \(y = ax + b\). In 2D, the line equation
    expresses the fact that a change in one dimension causes a change
    in one other. In 3D, a change in one dimension causes a change in
    two others which is hard to express in a similar form.
  </p>
  <p>
    Instead, in 3D a line is expressed as a starting position and an
    amount of movement in some direction. Statements about position
    and direction are best expressed mathematically with vectors and
    operations on vectors:

    $$\vec p = \vec{p_0} + t\vec{p_1}$$

    Plugging in different values of \(t\), for time, result in a line
    described by the same origin but a position vector pointing at a
    different point on the line (we consider a position vector and a
    point synonymous). Different values of \(t\) has the effect of
    scaling the position vector along the line and thus by varying
    \(t\) we can get to any position on the line.
  </p>
  <p>
    In ray tracing we're only interested in the half-line where \(t >
    0\). That half-line represents a ray traveling from the camera
    into the scene, and that's why we call it a ray instead of a
    line. \(t < 0\) would describe a ray traveling out back of the
    camera.
  </p>
  <p>
    As an example, we can find the parametric equation of the line
    passing through \((1,-1,4)\) in the direction of \((3,5,-1)\). We
    do so by plugging the two vectors into the vector equation for the
    line:

    $$\begin{eqnarray*}
    \vec p = (1,-1,4) + t(3,5,-2)\\
    \vec p = (1,-1,4) + (3t,5t,-2t)\\
    (x,y,z) = (1+3t,-1+5t,4-2t)
    \end{eqnarray*}$$
    
    For any scalar \(t\) we get any position vector on the line. For
    ray-sphere intersections, we're after the some values of \(t\)
    describing points of intersection. Once we have those values, we
    plug those into the parametric equation of a line to get the
    \((x,y,z)\) coordinate.
  </p>
  
  <h4>Line-sphere intersection, scalar edition</h4>
  <p>
    As an example, suppose we have the parametric equation of the line
    \((10 + 2t, 5 + t, 2)\) and the equation of a sphere in standard
    form \(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 9\). As with 2D intersection, we're after
    values for \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\) that when plugged into both
    equations make them equal. That implies we can plug in what we
    know about the unknowns of one equation into the other:

    $$\begin{eqnarray*}
    (10 + 2t)^2 + (5 + t)^2 + (2)^2 = 9 & & \textrm{\{plug in line equation\}}\\
    (10 + 2t)(10 + 2t) + (5 + t)(5 + t) + 4 = 9 & & \textrm{\{expand squares\}}\\
    100 + 20t + 20t + 4t^2 + 25 + 5t + 5t + t^2 + 4 = 9\\
    5t^2 + 50t + 129 = 9 & & \textrm{\{simplify and rearrange in \(t^2\), \(t\), constants order\}}\\
    5t^2 + 50t + 120 = 0 & & \textrm{\{move 9 to left side to get a standard form for quadratic equation\}}
    \end{eqnarray*}$$

    We went from one sphere equation with three unknowns, \(x\),
    \(y\), and \(z\) and ended up with a quadratic equation with one
    unknown, namely \(t\). Solving for \(t\) means using the same
    method
    as <a href="/blog/2018/09/01/ray-tracing-computing-ray-circle-intersections">previous</a>:

    $$\begin{eqnarray*}
    t = \dfrac{-b \pm \sqrt{d}}{2a} \textrm{, where \(d = b^2 - 4ac\) and \(a \neq 0\)}\\
    d = 50 - 4(5)(120) = 100\\
    t_1 = \dfrac{-50 + \sqrt{100}}{2(5)} = \dfrac{-50 + 10}{10} = \dfrac{-40}{10} = -4\\
    t_2 = \dfrac{-50 - \sqrt{100}}{2(5)} = \dfrac{-50 - 10}{10} = \dfrac{-60}{10} = -6\\
    \end{eqnarray*}$$     

    Plugging these values into the parametric vector equation, we get
    the points of line-sphere intersection:

    $$\begin{eqnarray*}
    \vec{p_1} = (x_1,y_1,z_1) = (10 + 2(-4) = 2, 5+ (-4) = 1, 2) = (2,1,2)\\
    \vec{p_2} = (x_2,y_2,z_2) = (10 + 2(-6) = -2, 5 + (-6) = -1, 2) = (-2,-1,2)
    \end{eqnarray*}$$

  </p>

  <h4>Line-sphere intersection, vector edition</h4>
  <p>
    We already established the standard vector equation for a
    line. For a sphere centered at \(c\) with radius \(r\), its
    corresponding standard vector equation is

    $$(\vec p - \vec c) \cdot (\vec p - \vec c) = r^2$$

    \(\vec p\) is position vectors on the sphere and \(\cdot\) is the
    dot product of two vectors. The term product in general refers to
    the result of a multiplication. Unlike the single definition for
    the product of scalars, vectors have two kinds of product: dot
    product and cross product.
  </p>
  <p>
    In the equations which follow, scalar product or dot product may
    be inferred from the context. We don't need the \(\cdot\) symbol,
    but it's convention. Like operator overloading in programming, if
    both operands are vectors, it means dot product, if one operand is
    a vector, it means scaling by that scalar, if both operands are
    scalars, it means regular multiplication.
  </p>
  <p>
    At first sight, the sphere vector equation look nothing like its
    scalar counterpart. But note the definition of the dot product:

    $$\vec u \cdot \vec v = {u_x}{v_x} + {u_y}{v_y} + {u_z}{v_z} = r^2$$    

    With this definition, if \(\vec{u} = \vec{v}\), which is the case
    for vector sphere definition, expanding the dot product turns into
    the original standard equation for a sphere. So while it may look
    mysterious, defining the sphere in terms of the dot product is
    correct:

    $$\vec u \cdot \vec u = {u_x}{u_x} + {u_y}{u_y} + {u_z}{u_z} =
    u_{x}^2 + u_{y}^2 + u_{z}^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = r^2$$
    
    In a similar way to how we plugged in the line equation into the
    equation of the sphere above, we can replace \(\vec p\) by the
    vector equation of the line because where they're the same must be
    where the line intersects with the sphere:

    $$(\vec{p_0} + \vec{p_1}t - \vec c) \cdot (\vec{p_0} + \vec{p_1}t - \vec c) - r^2 = 0$$

    Through rewriting and simplification, the goal is to turn this
    complicated looking equation into a quadratic one and solve it for
    \(t\). For an actual line and sphere, \(\vec{p_0}\),
    \(\vec{p_1}\), \(\vec c\), and \(r\) are known quantities, leaving
    \(t\) as the only unknown.
  </p>
  <p>
    $$\begin{eqnarray*}
    (\vec{p_0} \cdot \vec{p_0} + \vec{p_0} \cdot \vec{p_1}t - \vec{p_0} \cdot \vec c) + (\vec{p_1}t \cdot \vec{p_0} + \vec{p_1}t \cdot \vec{p_1}t - \vec{p_1}t \cdot \vec c) + (-\vec c \cdot \vec{p_0} - \vec c \cdot \vec{p_1}t + \vec c \cdot \vec c) - r^2 = 0 & & \textrm{\{expand square into 3 * 3 + 1 terms\}}\\

    \vec{p_0} \cdot \vec{p_0} + \vec{p_0} \cdot \vec{p_1}t - \vec{p_0} \cdot \vec c + \vec{p_1}t \cdot \vec{p_0} + \vec{p_1}t \cdot \vec{p_1}t - \vec{p_1}t \cdot \vec c - \vec c \cdot \vec{p_0} - \vec c \cdot \vec{p_1}t + \vec c \cdot \vec c - r^2 = 0 & & \textrm{\{remove parenthesis included as a visual aid in previous step\}}\\
    
    \vec{p_0} \cdot \vec{p_0} + \vec{p_0} \cdot \vec{p_1}t - \vec{p_0} \cdot \vec c + \vec{p_1}t \cdot \vec{p_0} + t^2(\vec{p_1} \cdot \vec{p_1}) - \vec{p_1}t \cdot \vec c - \vec c \cdot \vec{p_0} - \vec c \cdot \vec{p_1}t + \vec c \cdot \vec c - r^2 = 0 & & \textrm{\{factor out \(t\) in term where it appears twice\}}\\

    t^2(\vec{p_1} \cdot \vec{p_1}) + t(\vec{p_0} \cdot \vec{p_1} + \vec{p_1} \cdot \vec{p_0} - \vec{p_1} \cdot \vec c - \vec c \cdot \vec{p_1}) + \vec{p_0} \cdot \vec{p_0} - \vec{p_0} \cdot \vec c - \vec c \cdot \vec{p_0} + \vec c \cdot \vec c - r^2 = 0 & & \textrm{\{factor out \(t\) in terms where it appears once\}}\\

    t^2(\vec{p_1} \cdot \vec{p_1}) + t\vec{p_1}(\vec{p_0} + \vec{p_0} - \vec c - \vec c) + \vec{p_0} \cdot \vec{p_0} - \vec{p_0} \cdot \vec c - \vec c \cdot \vec{p_0} + \vec c \cdot \vec c - r^2 = 0 & & \textrm{\{factor out common \(p_1\) in \(t(...)\) part\}}\\    

    t^2(\vec{p_1} \cdot \vec{p_1}) + t\vec{p_1}(2\vec{p_0} - 2\vec c) + \vec{p_0} \cdot \vec{p_0} - \vec{p_0} \cdot \vec c - \vec c \cdot \vec{p_0} + \vec c \cdot \vec c - r^2 = 0 & & \textrm{\{group similar element inside \(t(...)\) part\}}\\    
    
    t^2(\vec{p_1} \cdot \vec{p_1}) + 2t \vec{p_1} \cdot (\vec{p_0} - \vec c) + \vec{p_0} \cdot \vec{p_0} - \vec{p_0} \cdot \vec c - \vec c \cdot \vec{p_0} + \vec c \cdot \vec c - r^2 = 0 & & \textrm{\{apply distributive law inside \(t(...)\) part: \(ab - ac = a(b - c)\) and remove extra parenthesis\}}\\    
    
    t^2(\vec{p_1} \cdot \vec{p_1}) + 2t \vec{p_1} \cdot (\vec{p_0} - \vec c) + \vec{p_0}^2 + \vec{c}^2 - 2\vec{p_0} \cdot \vec{c} - r^2 = 0 & & \textrm{\{group similar elements in constants part\}}\\
    
    t^2(\vec{p_1} \cdot \vec{p_1}) + 2t \vec{p_1} \cdot (\vec{p_0} - \vec c) + (\vec{p_0} + \vec c)^2 - r^2 = 0 & & \textrm{\{apply binomial square law in constants part: \(a^2 + b^2 - 2ab = (a - b)^2\)\}}\\       
    \end{eqnarray*}$$     

    or in terms of the standard form of a quadratic equation: \(at^2 + bt + c\)

    \begin{eqnarray*}
    a = \vec{p_1} \cdot \vec{p_1}\\
    b = 2\vec{p_1} \cdot (\vec{p_0} - \vec c)\\
    c = (\vec{p_0} + \vec c)^2 - r^2
    \end{eqnarray*}
    
    Note that calculating the dot product of two vectors results in a
    scalar, not a new vector. So even though the above equation may
    look complicated, once we plug in known vectors and simplify,
    we're left with a quadratic equation of the form \(ax^2 + bx +
    c\), although \(x\) is called \(t\).
  </p>
  <p>
    I struggled quite a bit with the simplifications because I don't
    have all possible rules memorized. For that
    case <a href="https://www.symbolab.com/solver/simplify-calculator/simplify%20p%2Bp%20%E2%88%92c%E2%88%92c">Symbollab.com</a>
    is helpful in that given an equation, it can identity the rule by
    name.
  </p>
  <p>
    As an example, let's redo the scalar example from above in which
    \(\vec{p_0} = (10,5,2)\), \(\vec{p_1} = (2,1,0)\), \(\vec c =
    (0,0,0)\), and \(r^2 = 9\):

    $$\begin{eqnarray*}
    t^2((2,1,0) \cdot (2,1,0)) + 2t(2,1,0) \cdot ((10,5,2)-(0,0,0)) + ((10,5,2) + (0,0,0) \cdot ((10,5,2) - (0,0,0)) - 3^2 = 0\\
    t^2(5) + 2t(2,1,0) \cdot (10,5,2) + ((10,5,2) \cdot (10,5,2)) - 9 = 0\\
    t^2(5) + 2t(2,1,0) \cdot (10,5,2) + (129) - 9 = 0\\
    t^2(5) + 2t(25) + 120 = 0\\
    t^2(5) + t(50) + 120 = 0\\
    5t^2 + 50t + 120 = 0
    \end{eqnarray*}$$

    which shows that the scalar and vector editions of ray-sphere
    intersection yield identical results.

  <h4>Summary</h4>
  <p>
    In computer graphics, we almost always want equations expressed in
    terms of vectors. This gives us the ability to treat the \(x\),
    \(y\), and \(z\) components of a vector as a single unit, making
    equations shorter and clearer. Similarly, defining and applying
    vector operations in code makes the code shorter and less
    error-phone. Thinking of a vector like this isn't much different
    than in object oriented programming when we create a class to
    group related data and operations on those data.
  </p>
  <p>
    With the equation derived in the vector edition section, we have
    the mathematical tools required to create a first ray tracer; one
    that shoots rays from the camera, through each pixel, and into the
    scene, coloring the pixel on ray-sphere intersections.
