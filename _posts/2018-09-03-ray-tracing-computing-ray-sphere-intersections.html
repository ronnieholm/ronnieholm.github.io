    Part 2: Ray tracing: Computing ray-sphere intersections
  </p> 
  
  <p>
    Whereas
    the <a href="/blog/2018/09/01/ray-tracing-computing-ray-circle-intersections">previous</a>
    post was about 2D ray-circle intersections with scalars, this one
    is about 3D ray-sphere intersections with vectors. We'll extend
    the circle standard equation to a sphere, and switch from scalar
    to vector notation for defining both line and sphere. With
    vectors, we can generalize and perform intersection calculations
    for any dimension in a succinct manner.
  </p>

  <h3>Sphere offset from origin</h3>
  <p>
    Except for the added third dimension, the equation of a sphere
    centered at a point \(c\) is identical to that of the circle. Its
    equation still follows from the Pythagorean theorem:

    $$(x - c_x)^2 + (y - c_y)^2 + (z - c_z)^2 = r^2$$

    With the spherecentered at the origin the \(c\) terms disappears
    and the equation becomes

    $$x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = r^2$$
  </p>

  <h3>Vector standard form of a line</h3>
  <p>
    Defining a line in 3D isn't as straightforward as in 2D. We don't
    have anything similar to \(y = ax + b\). In 2D, the line equation
    expresses that a change in one dimension can cause a change in at
    most one other dimension. In 3D, a change in one dimension can
    cause a change in at up to two other dimensions, which makes it
    hard to express in a similar form.
  </p>
  <p>
    Instead, a line is 3D is expressed as a starting position and an
    amount of movement in some direction. Statements about position
    and direction are best expressed with vectors and operations on
    vectors:

    $$\vec p = \vec{p_0} + t\vec{p_1}$$

    Plugging in different values of \(t\), for time, result in a line
    described by the same origin but a position vector pointing at
    different points on the line (we consider a position vector and a
    point synonymous). Different values of \(t\) has the effect of
    scaling the position vector along the line and thus by varying
    \(t\) we can get to any position on the line.
  </p>
  <p>
    In ray tracing we're only interested in the half-line where \(t >
    0\). That half-line represents a ray traveling from the camera
    into the scene, and that's why we refer to it as a ray instead of
    a line. \(t < 0\) would describe a ray traveling out back of the
    camera.
  </p>
  <p>
    As an example, we can find the parametric equation of the line
    passing through \((1,-1,4)\) in the direction of \((3,5,-1)\). We
    do so by plugging the two vectors into the vector equation for the
    line:

    $$\begin{eqnarray*}
    \vec p = (1,-1,4) + t(3,5,-2)\\
    \vec p = (1,-1,4) + (3t,5t,-2t)\\
    (x,y,z) = (1+3t,-1+5t,4-2t)
    \end{eqnarray*}$$
    
    For any scalar \(t\) we get any position vector on the line. For
    ray-sphere intersections, we're after some values of \(t\)
    describing points of intersection. Once we have those values, we
    plug those into the parametric equation of a line to get the
    \((x,y,z)\) coordinate of intersection.
  </p>
  
  <h3>Line and sphere intersections, scalar edition</h3>
  <p>
    As an example, suppose we have the parametric equation of the line
    \((10 + 2t, 5 + t, 2)\) and the equation of a sphere in standard
    form \(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 9\). As with 2D intersection, we're after
    values for \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\) that when plugged into both
    equations make them equal. This implies we can plug in what we
    know about the unknowns of one equation into the other:

    $$\begin{eqnarray*}
    (10 + 2t)^2 + (5 + t)^2 + (2)^2 = 9 & & \textrm{\{plug in line equation\}}\\
    (10 + 2t)(10 + 2t) + (5 + t)(5 + t) + 4 = 9 & & \textrm{\{expand squares\}}\\
    100 + 20t + 20t + 4t^2 + 25 + 5t + 5t + t^2 + 4 = 9 & & \textrm{\{expand parenthesis\}}\\
    5t^2 + 50t + 129 = 9 & & \textrm{\{simplify and rearrange in \(t^2\), \(t\), constants order\}}\\
    5t^2 + 50t + 120 = 0 & & \textrm{\{move 9 to left side to arrive at standard form of quadratic equation\}}
    \end{eqnarray*}$$

    We went from one sphere equation with three unknowns, \(x\),
    \(y\), and \(z\) and ended up with a quadratic equation with one
    unknown \(t\). Solving for \(t\) means applying the same method
    as <a href="/blog/2018/09/01/ray-tracing-computing-ray-circle-intersections">previous</a>:

    $$\begin{eqnarray*}
    t = \dfrac{-b \pm \sqrt{d}}{2a} \textrm{, where \(d = b^2 - 4ac\)}\\
    d = 50 - 4(5)(120) = 100\\
    t_1 = \dfrac{-50 + \sqrt{100}}{2(5)} = \dfrac{-50 + 10}{10} = \dfrac{-40}{10} = -4\\
    t_2 = \dfrac{-50 - \sqrt{100}}{2(5)} = \dfrac{-50 - 10}{10} = \dfrac{-60}{10} = -6\\
    \end{eqnarray*}$$     

    Plugging these values of \(t\) into the parametric vector
    equation, we get the points of line-sphere intersection:

    $$\begin{eqnarray*}
    \vec{p_1} = (x_1,y_1,z_1) = (10 + 2(-4) = 2, 5+ (-4) = 1, 2) = (2,1,2)\\
    \vec{p_2} = (x_2,y_2,z_2) = (10 + 2(-6) = -2, 5 + (-6) = -1, 2) = (-2,-1,2)
    \end{eqnarray*}$$

  <h3>Line and sphere intersections, vector edition</h3>
  <p>
    Above we established the standard vector equation for a line. For
    a sphere centered at \(c\) with radius \(r\), its corresponding
    standard vector equation is

    $$(\vec p - \vec c) \cdot (\vec p - \vec c) = r^2$$

    \(\vec p\) represents position vectors on the sphere and \(\cdot\)
    is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_product">dot
    product</a> of two vectors. The term product in general refers to
    the result of a multiplication. But unlike the single definition
    of the product of scalars, vectors have two definitions of
    product: dot product and cross product. We're only using the dot
    product, defined as the sum of the products of the corresponding
    entries. The dot product of two vectors is a scalar, not another
    vector.
  </p>
  <p>
    In the equations which follow, the use of scalar product or dot
    product can be inferred based on whether both operands are scalars
    or vectors. Strictly speaking, we don't need the \(\cdot\) symbol,
    but it's convention.
  </p>
  <p>
    At first sight, the sphere standard vector equation looks nothing
    like its scalar counterpart. But note the definition of the dot
    product:

    $$\vec u \cdot \vec v = {u_x}{v_x} + {u_y}{v_y} + {u_z}{v_z} = r^2$$    

    With this definition, if \(\vec{u} = \vec{v}\), as is the case for
    the vector sphere definition, expanding the dot product turns it
    into the original standard equation of a sphere. So while at first
    sight the dot product and sphere seems unrelated, defining the
    sphere in terms of the dot product is valid:

    $$\vec u \cdot \vec u = {u_x}{u_x} + {u_y}{u_y} + {u_z}{u_z} =
    u_{x}^2 + u_{y}^2 + u_{z}^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = r^2$$
    
    Similar as with scalars above, where we plugged in the line
    equation into the equation of the sphere, we can replace \(\vec
    p\) in the sphere equation by the vector equation of the line
    (don't be confused by the use of \(\vec p\) in both the line and
    sphere definitions. Those are different \(\vec p\)s):

    $$(\vec{p_0} + \vec{p_1}t - \vec c) \cdot (\vec{p_0} + \vec{p_1}t - \vec c) - r^2 = 0$$

    Through rewriting and simplification, the goal is to turn this
    complicated looking equation into a quadratic one and solve for
    \(t\). For an actual line and sphere, \(\vec{p_0}\),
    \(\vec{p_1}\), \(\vec c\), and \(r\) are known quantities, leaving
    \(t\) as the only unknown.
  </p>
  <p>
    $$\begin{eqnarray*}
    (\vec{p_0} \cdot \vec{p_0} + \vec{p_0} \cdot \vec{p_1}t - \vec{p_0} \cdot \vec c) + (\vec{p_1}t \cdot \vec{p_0} + \vec{p_1}t \cdot \vec{p_1}t - \vec{p_1}t \cdot \vec c) + (-\vec c \cdot \vec{p_0} - \vec c \cdot \vec{p_1}t + \vec c \cdot \vec c) - r^2 = 0 & & \textrm{\{expand square into 3 * 3 + 1 terms\}}\\

    \vec{p_0} \cdot \vec{p_0} + \vec{p_0} \cdot \vec{p_1}t - \vec{p_0} \cdot \vec c + \vec{p_1}t \cdot \vec{p_0} + \vec{p_1}t \cdot \vec{p_1}t - \vec{p_1}t \cdot \vec c - \vec c \cdot \vec{p_0} - \vec c \cdot \vec{p_1}t + \vec c \cdot \vec c - r^2 = 0 & & \textrm{\{remove parenthesis included as a visual aid in previous step\}}\\
    
    \vec{p_0} \cdot \vec{p_0} + \vec{p_0} \cdot \vec{p_1}t - \vec{p_0} \cdot \vec c + \vec{p_1}t \cdot \vec{p_0} + t^2(\vec{p_1} \cdot \vec{p_1}) - \vec{p_1}t \cdot \vec c - \vec c \cdot \vec{p_0} - \vec c \cdot \vec{p_1}t + \vec c \cdot \vec c - r^2 = 0 & & \textrm{\{factor out \(t\) in term where it appears twice\}}\\

    t^2(\vec{p_1} \cdot \vec{p_1}) + t(\vec{p_0} \cdot \vec{p_1} + \vec{p_1} \cdot \vec{p_0} - \vec{p_1} \cdot \vec c - \vec c \cdot \vec{p_1}) + \vec{p_0} \cdot \vec{p_0} - \vec{p_0} \cdot \vec c - \vec c \cdot \vec{p_0} + \vec c \cdot \vec c - r^2 = 0 & & \textrm{\{factor out \(t\) in terms where it appears once\}}\\

    t^2(\vec{p_1} \cdot \vec{p_1}) + t\vec{p_1}(\vec{p_0} + \vec{p_0} - \vec c - \vec c) + \vec{p_0} \cdot \vec{p_0} - \vec{p_0} \cdot \vec c - \vec c \cdot \vec{p_0} + \vec c \cdot \vec c - r^2 = 0 & & \textrm{\{factor out common \(\vec{p_1}\) in \(t(...)\) part\}}\\    

    t^2(\vec{p_1} \cdot \vec{p_1}) + t\vec{p_1}(2\vec{p_0} - 2\vec c) + \vec{p_0} \cdot \vec{p_0} - \vec{p_0} \cdot \vec c - \vec c \cdot \vec{p_0} + \vec c \cdot \vec c - r^2 = 0 & & \textrm{\{group similar element inside \(t(...)\) part\}}\\    
    
    t^2(\vec{p_1} \cdot \vec{p_1}) + 2t \vec{p_1} \cdot (\vec{p_0} - \vec c) + \vec{p_0} \cdot \vec{p_0} - \vec{p_0} \cdot \vec c - \vec c \cdot \vec{p_0} + \vec c \cdot \vec c - r^2 = 0 & & \textrm{\{apply distributive law inside \(t(...)\) part: \(ab - ac = a(b - c)\) and remove extra parenthesis\}}\\    
    
    t^2(\vec{p_1} \cdot \vec{p_1}) + 2t \vec{p_1} \cdot (\vec{p_0} - \vec c) + \vec{p_0}^2 + \vec{c}^2 - 2\vec{p_0} \cdot \vec{c} - r^2 = 0 & & \textrm{\{group similar elements in constants part\}}\\
    
    t^2(\vec{p_1} \cdot \vec{p_1}) + 2t \vec{p_1} \cdot (\vec{p_0} - \vec c) + (\vec{p_0} + \vec c)^2 - r^2 = 0 & & \textrm{\{apply binomial square law in constants part: \(a^2 + b^2 - 2ab = (a - b)^2\)\}}\\       
    \end{eqnarray*}$$     

    Or in terms of the standard form of a quadratic equation: \(at^2 +
    bt + c\)

    \begin{eqnarray*}
    a = \vec{p_1} \cdot \vec{p_1}\\
    b = 2\vec{p_1} \cdot (\vec{p_0} - \vec c)\\
    c = (\vec{p_0} + \vec c)^2 - r^2
    \end{eqnarray*}
    
    Because the dot product of two vectors results in a scalar, once
    we plug in the known elements (\(\vec{p_0}\), \(\vec{p_1}\),
    \(\vec c\), and \(r\)) and simplify, we're left with a quadratic
    equation of the form \(at^2 + bt + c\).
  </p>
  <p>
    Carrying out the simplification steps requires the memorization of
    rules. Given an equation, a site such as
    <a href="https://www.symbolab.com/solver/simplify-calculator/simplify%20p%2Bp%20%E2%88%92c%E2%88%92c">Symbollab.com</a>
    can help identity the rule by name and carry out the
    simplification.
  </p>
  <p>
    Continuing with the scalar example from above in which \(\vec{p_0}
    = (10,5,2)\), \(\vec{p_1} = (2,1,0)\), \(\vec c = (0,0,0)\), and
    \(r^2 = 9\):

    $$\begin{eqnarray*}
    t^2((2,1,0) \cdot (2,1,0)) + 2t(2,1,0) \cdot ((10,5,2)-(0,0,0)) + ((10,5,2) + (0,0,0) \cdot ((10,5,2) - (0,0,0)) - 3^2 = 0\\
    t^2(5) + 2t(2,1,0) \cdot (10,5,2) + ((10,5,2) \cdot (10,5,2)) - 9 = 0\\
    t^2(5) + 2t(2,1,0) \cdot (10,5,2) + (129) - 9 = 0\\
    t^2(5) + 2t(25) + 120 = 0\\
    t^2(5) + t(50) + 120 = 0\\
    5t^2 + 50t + 120 = 0
    \end{eqnarray*}$$

    which shows that the scalar and vector editions yield identical
    results.

  <h3>Summary</h3>
  <p>
    In computer graphics, we almost always want equations expressed in
    terms of vectors. This gives us the ability to treat the \(x\),
    \(y\), and \(z\) components of a vector as a single unit, making
    equations shorter and clearer. Similarly, defining and applying
    vector operations in code makes the code shorter and less
    error-phone. Working with vectors like this isn't much different
    than in object oriented programming when we create a class to
    group related data and operations.
  </p>
  <p>
    With the derived line-sphere vector intersection equation, we now
    have the mathematical tool required to create a first ray tracer;
    one that shoots rays from the camera, through each pixel, and into
    the scene, coloring pixels on ray-sphere intersections.
