<div id="post">

<p>Users have reported that during work hours a SharePoint document
library view takes two to four minutes to load. The library itself
holds only 510 documents, and Chrome Developer Tools reveals that the
issue isn't a bandwidth issue. Once the server returns the ASPX page,
containing the view data, the ASPX page size is 169 KB and the total
page payload is 236 KB cached and 2.6 MB not cached. Furthermore,
because the ASPX page is the one referencing images, JavaScript, CSS,
and the like, no other resources begins to load until the ASPX page is
returned and parsed.</p>

<p>This post attempts to pinpoint what the two to four minutes load
time is spent on. It does so by breaking down the load time into
components of the view and page, such as grouping, item limit, managed
metadata fields, and navigation. Each test case exercised below
consist of a sampling of five page loads, changing a single variable
at the time.</p>

<p>On shared infrastructure, it may require a few attempts to gather
consistent numbers with a consistent average and low standard
deviation. For all test cases, we sample three times and pick the
best. We should also
take <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Using-the-object-cache-with-SharePoint-Online-38bc9c14-3826-449c-beb6-b1003bcbeaaf">SharePoint
Online's use of the object cache</a> into account. Frontend servers do
have object caching enabled, but compared to on-premises it has little
effect on load times.</p>

<p>The concluding section at the end presents a summary of the timing
of each test case.</p>

<h4>Establishing a baseline</h4>

<p>To establish a baseline on which to improve, we sample loading the
slow view (Documents/Forms/AllItems.aspx) and arrive at an average
load time of 27.9 seconds.</p>

<h4>Common causes for extended view load times</h4>

<p>Starting from typical causes of slowness, and knowing that slowness
has likely crept in gradually as the number of list items or webs
increased, we can form hypotheses to test:</p>

<ul>

<li><p>Is the view's item limit above the default 30? A larger value
tends to make little sense as users aren't likely to read through a
long list anyway. Instead users apply additional filtering to find a
document. For the view in question, the item limit is 300.</p></li>

<li><p>How many lookup fields does the view contain? Lookup fields are
those of types <i>Managed metadata</i> and <i>Person or
Group</i>. These cause SharePoint to run additional queries against
the
<a href="http://sharepointviews.com/hidden-users-list-in-sharepoint/">hidden
users list</a>
and <a href="http://info.summit7systems.com/blog/troubleshooting-sharepoints-hidden-list-and-managed-metadata-columns">hidden
taxonomy list</a> of the root web. When in edit mode the real user and
taxomomy store is used, but views rely on the hidden lists for better
performance. Of the document library's 11 lookup fields 10 are part of
the slow view.</p></li>

<li><p>What's the web's navigation complexity? SharePoint defaults
to structural navigation for the top links and quick launch menus, but
other <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Navigation-options-for-SharePoint-Online-adb92b80-b342-4ecb-99a1-da2a2b4782eb">navigation
options</a> such as managed navigation and search-driven navigation
exist. In this case, the navigation is structural with the web
inheriting top links from its parent, consisting of multiple levels of
web links.</p></li>

<li><p>Does the document library and items retain role inheritance?
Breaking role inheritance means SharePoint must do extra work to
security trim elements in the view. In this case, the web, list, and
items inherit permissions from the parent.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>Based on the typical causes of slow performance, we start by
looking into the cost of loading the non-view parts of the
page. Moreover, the cost of an item limit of 300 and the cost of
two-level group by on Managed Metadata fields, including group
expansion, calls for investigation.</p>

<h4>Overhead of non-view part of page</h4>

<p>We can determine the impact that non-view components have on view
load by measuring against a page which cannot be modified and which
has minimal dynamic content. One such page is the Site Settings
application page (_layouts/15/settings.aspx). While its content is
static it includes both top links and quick launch menus. Furthermore,
to gauge relative performance, we also measure against the Site
Settings page of an out of the box team site without inherited
navigation.</p>

<p>On average the Site Settings page takes 3.5 seconds to load. The
same Site Settings page on an out of the box team site, however, load
in only 0.7 seconds. Hence 2.8 seconds is spent loading the navigation
components on the page hosting the slow view. In other words, short of
changing the navigation, 2.8 seconds marks the lower bound on view
page load time (and any other page load time on that web).</p>

<h4>Flattening the view</h4>

<p>Flattening the view by disabling group by on two managed metadata
fields while keeping expansion turned on, we arrive at a surprising
result. The load time goes down from 27.9 seconds to 7.5
seconds. That's a surprise, given that the document library holds only
510 items and that group by on so few items would seems
computationally fast. Perhaps SQL Server isn't optimized for group by
operations in views, perhaps it's the fact that we're grouping on
managed metadata fields that throws off the optimizer.</p>

<p>Factoring in the 2.8 seconds non-view load time, 7.5 seconds is
bordering acceptable. Users may have a good business reason for
grouping, though, in which
case <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Set-up-metadata-navigation-for-a-list-or-library-c222a75d-8b18-44e2-9ed8-7ee4e0d23cfc?ui=en-US&rs=en-US&ad=US">setting
up metadata navigation on the list</a> might be worth pursuing.</p>

<h4>Removing lookup fields from the view</h4>

<p>Next, we measure the cost of the view's 10 lookup fields by
removing those from the flat view. It causes an additional decrease in
load time from 7.5 seconds to 5.1 seconds, meaning the lookup field
overhead is 2.4 seconds. Compare those numbers to the 4.7 seconds it
takes to load a view with only the name field (meaning that the
remaining non-managed metadata fields have almost no overhead) and the
4.8 seconds with the original fields but expansion turned off (meaning
that expansion is an expensive operation).</p>

<h4>Reducing the item limit</h4>

<p>By reducing the item limit from 300 to 30, even including group by
and expansion, page load time becomes 6.4 seconds. If we disable group
by we arrive at 4.2 seconds.</p>

<h4>Conclusion</h4>

<p>The table below summarizes the measurements performed outside
business hours and from an Azure virtual machine. Using an Azure host
eliminates potential issues with the local network skewing the
result. The assumption is that it's more likely to experience issues
on the local network than within the Azure infrastructure:</p>

<pre>
                                                                   Avg  StdDev
= Sort by name, two-level group by expanded, 300 item limit       27.9     2.4
With 30 item limit                                                 6.4     0.9   
Without two-level group by expanded                                7.5     0.7
Without two-level group by expanded, without lookup field          5.1     0.5
Without two-level group by expanded, without all but name field    4.7     0.2
Without expansion                                                  4.8     0.4
Without two-level group by expanded, with 30 item limit            4.2     0.3
Without non-view part of baseline page                             3.5     0.4
= Non-view part of out of the box new web                          0.7     0.1
</pre>

<p>All in all, we've managed to bring down view load time from 27.9
seconds to 4.8 seconds by disabling expansion and down to 4.2 seconds
by disabling group by and limiting the view to 30 items. Considering
the constant non-view overhead of 2.8 seconds, both of these numbers
are within SharePoint's normal operating parameters.</p>

<p>In addition to the tweaks above, setting up metadata navigation
might be an avenue worth pursuing. Even when metadata navigation
hasn't been explicitly configured for the list, enabling its
<i>Metadata Navigation and Filtering</i> feature turns on an automatic
query optimizer which creates up to 20 indices on the list a based on
use.</p>
