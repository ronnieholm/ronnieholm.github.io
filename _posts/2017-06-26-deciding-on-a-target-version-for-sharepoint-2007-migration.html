<div id="post">

<p>This post outlines the pros and cons of migrating the functionality
and content of a SharePoint 2007 farm to a new home, i.e., from one
datacenter or hosting partner to another. Given that extended support
for SharePoint 2007 is about to end, the question is which version of
SharePoint to migrate to. This post attempts to balance the relative
merits of three options: (1) staying with SharePoint 2007 but on a new
farm, (2) moving to a higher on-premise version of SharePoint, or (3)
moving to in-cloud SharePoint Online.</p>

<p>Given the potential intricate nature of SharePoint 2007 -- with
custom development and third-party product -- the answer of which
target version to migration to isn't as clear cut as it may seems.</p>

<p>In the options below, <font color="green">green</font> and <font
color="red">red</font> is used to denote pros and cons,
respectively. Each of the pros and cons arose from a recent migration
project.</p>

<h4>Terminology used in this post</h4>

<ul>

  <li><p><i>On-premise vs. in-cloud</i>. On-premise SharePoint refers
      to any version of SharePoint except SharePoint Online. Whether
      SharePoint is deployed on-premise or in a non-Microsoft
      datacenter, SharePoint is still considered on-premise. True
      in-cloud SharePoint is SharePoint Online (SaaS) only, dependent
      on Azure (PaaS), and hosted in a Microsoft datacenter.</p></li>

  <li><p><i>Farm</i>. Denotes a collection of Windows servers making
      up a SharePoint hosting environment. To users and applications
      hosted on SharePoint, these servers make up a logical cluster
      with which they interact. In principle, SharePoint's services
      are provided by a single server or partitioned amongst any
      number of servers, acting in unison. The more servers, the
      better performance, fault tolerance, and so on.</p></li> </ul>

<h4>Common concerns independent of target environment</h4>

<ul>

  <li><p><i>In-depth analysis of SharePoint 2007 farm</i>. Independent
    of the options below, a significant investment in time must go
    into analyzing the existing farm. With little or no governance to
    rely upon in such old environment, we'll have to document platform
    settings in reverse, and mirror those setting in the new
    environment. The consequence of missing or not understanding the
    ramifications of a setting can result in the new environment
    malfunctioning in a not obvious way. In general, migration without
    existing, up to date documentation is best-effort. This lack of
    guarantee particularly applies to on-premise targets. For
    in-cloud, likely no current custom code or third-party products
    will work as-is. In other words, a migration to on-premise is
    likely going to add latent instability to the platform.</p></li>

<h4>Option 1: SharePoint 2007 -> SharePoint 2007</h4>

<p>Considering a SharePoint 2007 to SharePoint 2007 migration, we need
to install from scratch the software stack from the operating system
and up. SharePoint doesn't support cloning an existing SharePoint
server and restoring its image on new hardware.</p>

<ul> 

  <li><p><font color="green">Microsoft licensing</font>. Existing
      Windows Server, SharePoint, and MS SQL Server licenses are
      candidates for reuse in the new farm.</p></li>

  <li><p><font color="green">Feature parity</font>. Because source and
      target farms are both SharePoint 2007, and because dependent
      software such as Windows and SQL Server remain fixed at their
      current versions, source and target are compatible. As a
      consequence, we can apply regular SQL Server database backup and
      restore procedures to move content across farms, making the
      migration low risk.</p></li>

  <li><p><font> color="green">SharePoint and Nintex Workflows survive
      migration</font>. Any existing SharePoint or Nintex workflow
      remains unaffected by the migration, i.e., long-running
      workflows will pick up where they left off in the old
      environment.</p></li>

  <li><p><font color="red">Third-party licensing</font>. For any
      non-Microsoft product part of the farm, such as Nintex and
      Bamboo Solution, different license terms may apply. For each
      product, the vendor must be contacted to clarify license terms,
      and provide lost installation media and documentation.</p></li>

  <li><p><font color="red">Third-party products no longer
      supported</font>. While third-party licenses likely remain
      valid, for some products support has likely expired. As a
      consequence, issues with third-party products arising from the
      migration may not be resolvable.</p></li>

  <li><p><font color="red">SharePoint 2007 no longer supported by
      Microsoft</font>. Mainstream support for SharePoint 2007 ended
      October 9, 2012 and extended support <a
      href="https://support.microsoft.com/da-dk/help/3198497/office-2007-approaching-end-of-extended-support">ends</a>
      October 10, 2017. Following end of extended support, Microsoft
      no longer provides security updates or general support. With the
      proper agreements, Microsoft can, however, provide
      troubleshooting support, but on a low-priority, best-effort
      basis.</p></li>

  <li><p><font color="red">No development environment
      available</font>. In case custom functionality fails as part of
      migration and needs correcting, likely no up to date SharePoint
      2007 development exist to test, update, and re-package the
      functionality. Worse yet, we can't be certain to have located
      the source code behind every deployed feature. In case we
      haven't, and the feature is essential, it need
      redeveloping.</p></li> </ul>

<h4>Option 2: SharePoint 2007 -> SharePoint 2010 (or higher)</h4>

<p>When referring to SharePoint 2010, we're actually referring to
SharePoint 2010 or any higher on-premise version. Besides, with
SharePoint it isn't possible to skip versions along the migration
path. Migration from SharePoint 2007 to SharePoint 2016, for instance,
requires establishing intermediate farms along the migration path for
SharePoint 2010 and SharePoint 2013. By induction, for each farm along
the migration path, each point below requires revisiting. Migrating to
SharePoint 2016 roughly amounts to a three-fold increase in complexity
over staying with SharePoint 2007.</p>

<ul>

  <li><p><font color="green">SharePoint 2010 still supported by
      Microsoft</font>. While mainstream support ended October 13,
      2015, <a
      href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/lifecycle/search?sort=PN&alpha=Microsoft%20SharePoint%20Server%202010&Filter=FilterNO">extended
      support</a>, covering only security updates, is in effect till
      October 13, 2020. Updates containing new features have ceased
      with mainstream support, though.</p></li>

  <li><p><font color="red">New Microsoft licenses
      required</font>. Applies not only to SharePoint 2010 itself, but
      to dependent software such as SQL Server and Windows.</p></li>

  <li><p><font color="red">New third-party licenses required.</font>
      For each third-party product (Nintex, Bamboo solution, and so
      on), we must locate a compatible SharePoint 2010 version. For
      some products, a SharePoint 2010 version may no longer be
      available.</p></li>

  <li><p><font color="red">SharePoint 2010 pre-upgrade check likely
      reveals issues</font>. Microsoft supplies a pre-upgrade check
      tool to assess the readiness of a SharePoint 2007 farm prior to
      upgrading. For a large SharePoint 2007 farm, the tool likely
      reveals many issues which need fixing before the upgrade can
      proceed. We must resolve these issues in the SharePoint 2007
      farm, running the risk of breaking existing
      functionality.</p></li>

  <li><p><font color="red">Not all workflows can survive
      migration</font>. It's unlikely that all SharePoint and Nintex
      workflow can survive a migration. It's likely that part of, or
      the whole of, many workflows aren't supported by a higher
      version. While SharePoint workflows are covered by the
      SharePoint 2010 pre-upgrade check, Nintex provides its
      own <a href="
      https://community.nintex.com/docs/DOC-1177">pre-upgrade
      check</a>, targeted at Nintex 2007 workflows.</li></p>

  <li><p><font color="red">No feature parity</font>. With SharePoint
      2010 being newer, Microsoft deprecated some SharePoint 2007
      features and added new ones. In practice, it means the migration
      involves the mapping of SharePoint 2007 features onto SharePoint
      2010, and that some customizations may require
      re-development.</p></li>

  <li><p><font color="red">Development environment
      required</font>. Whereas a development environment may be
      optional in the SharePoint 2007 case, it's mandatory with
      SharePoint 2010. Customization may have hardcoded references to
      SharePoint 2007 locations (file system path, registry path,
      package structure and content) and requires a rebuild from
      source.</p></li>

</ul>

<h4>Option 3: SharePoint 2007 -> SharePoint Online</h4>

<ul>

  <li><p><font color="green">Ability to treat SharePoint as SaaS
      environment</font>. The responsibility of backing up and
      restoring SharePoint and of monitoring and patching is on
      Microsoft. Customers cannot stay on an old version, and accrue
      technical debt, but are nudged forward by Microsoft continuously
      rolling out updates to the platform.</p></li>

  <li><p><font color="green">Decommissioning on-premise server
      farms</font>. The existing SharePoint 2007 farms may consist of
      development, testing, pre-production, and production become
      redundant. The money which goes to their maintainance and
      associated technical tasks can be focused elsewhere.</p></li>

  <li><p><font color="green">No need for dedicated SharePoint
      development environment</font>. With SharePoint Online, any
      machine with .NET development tools can develop for
      SharePoint. SharePoint Online and Azure services can make up for
      the development environment.</p></li>

  <li><p><font color="green">Possible existing experience with content
      migration</font>. Custom tools and Sharegate may be used to
      migrate content from the source environment.</p></li>

  <li><p><font color="red">Reuse of existing licenses</font>. For a
      user to access SharePoint Online, the user requires an Office
      365 license. Depending on the ratio of employees to externals
      (with no default license) this may be an issue.</p></li>

  <li><p><font color="red">Database content migration not
      supported</font>. With SharePoint Online's development model,
      Microsoft prohibits direct server access, and thus direct
      database to database migration of content isn't
      possible. Instead, existing content needs re-adding through
      Microsoft's web service APIs using either a custom tool or
      Sharegate.</p></li>

  <li><p><font color="red">Nintex on-premise to in-cloud not
      supported</font>. At a technical level, the Nintex of SharePoint
      Online <a
      href="https://community.nintex.com/thread/1323">differs</a> from
      the Nintex of on-premise. Even though Sharegate offers some
      workflow migration support, in all likeliness many workflows
      require recreation by hand with gaps in functionality to be
      worked out.</p></li>

  <li><p><font color="red">No feature parity</font>. The closest
      parity is with SharePoint 2016 as that's the version behind
      SharePoint Online. But many on-premise services are unavailable
      in-cloud or work differently. It's unlikely that any custom code
      developed for SharePoint 2007 can be migrated as-is. To achieve
      the same functionality in SharePoint Online, the code needs to
      be re-developed, following the SharePoint Online development
      model. As a supplement to missing SharePoint functionality,
      Nintex Online Workflows and Forms may be called for.</p></li>

</ul>

<h4>Conclusion</h4>

<p>Migrating SharePoint 2007 to a new on-premise farm, even SharePoint
2007, is best-effort and will likely end up taking a disproportionate
amount of time compared to the benefits realized. Given that
SharePoint Online is likely the strategic platform of choice, the
migration effort is best directed towards SharePoint Online, skipping
intermediate platforms and using custom solutions in tandem with
Sharegate.</p>
