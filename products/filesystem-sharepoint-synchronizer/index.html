    <p><strong>What does Filesystem/SharePoint Synchronizer do?</strong></p>

    <p>It's a Windows service that you configure to listen for changes to any number of directories, either locally or on a network share. As files or folders within these directories change, these changes are pushed to SharePoint 2013/Office 365 document libraries.</p>

    <p><strong>When is Filesystem/SharePoint synchronizer useful?</strong></p>

    <p>If you already have documents stored within a folder structure outside SharePoint, you don't need to partition and move these documents to SharePoint to take advantage of the SharePoint platform. Instead you can leverage the versioning, collaboration, and search aspects of SharePoint while still using local files and folders.</p>

    <p><strong>What are the system requirements of Filesystem/SharePoint synchronizer?</strong></p>

    <p>The only requirement is .NET framework 4.5.</p>

    <p><strong>What does Filesystem/SharePoint synchronizer cost?</strong></p>

    <p>The price is Â£99 per seat.</p>
