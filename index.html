    <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
    <p>
      I specialize in creating high-quality, professionally built software that's thoroughly tested. 
      No hacks or shortcuts, just software that adds actual business value. I prefer to use agile
      methodologies to distill requirements through workshops and built the solution iteratively.

      <p>
	I facilitate requirement gathering workshops and prototype high-risk or uncertain parts of a
	solution first to strike the right balance between functionality, simplicity, and maintainabilty. 
	I then implement the solution using short cycles and close customer collaboration.

      <h2>Technologies</h2>
      <p>
	I mostly develop native or web-based solutions for the Windows platform using .NET and C#/F#
	using Winforms, WPF, ASP.NET MVC, SharePoint/Office 365, and SQL server, but also have 
	experience with Linux-based solutions.

      <p>
        I built a product to synchronize local filesystems or network shares with SharePoint document 
        libraries. It's intended for organizations who want to leverage the versioning, collaboration, 
        and search aspects of SharePoint, yet aren't ready to transition away from regular files and 
        folders.
