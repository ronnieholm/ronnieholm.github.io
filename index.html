      <h2>Services</h2>
      <p>
	We facilitate requirement gathering workshops and prototype
	high-risk or uncertain pieces first to strike the right
	balance between functionality, simplicity, and
	maintainabilty. We strive to implement solutions using short
	cycles and close customer collaboration.

      <h2>Technologies</h2>
      <p>
	We mostly develop native or web-based solutions for the
	Windows platform using a mix of .NET, C#, F#, ASP.NET MVC,
	SharePoint/Office 365, and SQL server, but also have
	experience with Linux-based solutions.

      <h2>Products</h2>
      <p>
        We sell a product to synchronize local filesystems or network
        shares with SharePoint document libraries, intended for
        organizations who want to leverage the versioning,
        collaboration, and search aspects of SharePoint, yet aren't
        ready to transition away from regular files and folders.
