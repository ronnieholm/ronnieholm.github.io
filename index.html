      <h2>Services</h2>
      <p>
	We facilitate requirement gathering workshops and prototype high risk or uncertain parts of a future solution to arrive at a solution design that strikes the right balance between functionality, simplicity, and maintainabilty. We then implement the solution using short cycles and close customer collaboration.

      <h2>Technologies</h2>
      <p>
	We mostly develop for the Windows platform using the .NET framework and languages like C# and F#, with web-based solutions based on ASP.NET MVC, SharePoint/Office 365, and SQL server, but also have experience with Linux-based technologies.

      <h2>Products</h2>
      <p>
        We build a product to synchronize local filesystems or network shares with SharePoint document libraries. It's intended for organizations who want to leverage the versioning, collaboration, and search aspects of SharePoint, yet don't want to transition away from regular files and folders.
